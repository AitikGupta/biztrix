								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Customer service has gone through a sea of changes in the
recent past. So far, the changes have helped businesses improve the quality of
customer service and deliver state-of-the-art customer experience.</p>



<p>So, what made businesses think that a change in their
customer service model is necessary? Here are four realities that compelled
businesses to rethink:</p>



<h3>1. Smartphones In Every Pocket </h3>



<p>Nowadays one can find heavily featured smartphones being used in different parts of the world. Pew Research <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2999631/phones/pew-survey-shows-68-percent-of-americans-now-own-a-smartphone.html">reports</a> that in 2015 68% of American adults owned smartphones, almost double the 35% penetration in 2011. That means nearly every American has a supercomputer in his or her pocket.</p>



<p>The smartphone and the tablet are all-purpose devices that let us interact in a variety of modes &#8211; phone, email, text, web chat, video chat, social media, online forums and much more. As a result, people do not want to stick with just one mode of communication at a time: they switch modes as they please, and expect companies to keep up so that they don&#8217;t have to repeat their back-story to different personnel along the way. </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>With a smartphone in every pocket, companies can no longer stick to just one or two customer interaction channels. They should be present in a variety of channels so that a customer can reach them easily via the channel of his/her choice. When it comes to customer service, omnichannel is the way to go. </p>



<p>With <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/benefits-of-adopting-omnichannel-customer-support.html">omnichannel customer service</a>, a customer receives a seamless experience across all channels. Now, that is a customer service model that never goes out of style.</p>



<h3>2. 5G </h3>



<p>Over the next two years, the transition from 4G to 5G will make the public wireless network experience a huge 300 times faster. With <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-5g-everything-you-need-to-know">5G</a>, we will see devoted slices of spectrum, ready for tuning and optimization for specific applications and devices. The blend of these two phenomena, when met with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-internet-things-affect-customer-service-near-future-saraogi/">IoT</a>/M2M devices, will facilitate secure real-time data transfer. That means no delay. </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>In the age of 5G the faster a company can put data into action, the more value it can deliver. This is only possible when you put AI into the mix. When your customer service agents get <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">real-time assistance from AI</a>, it will be possible for them to assist your customers right away.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5G.jpg" alt="5G" class="wp-image-6617" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5G.jpg 650w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5G-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></figure></div>



<p>Here’s an example – if you get a call from your customer that his/her car broke down in the middle of the road, your customer service agent can take help of AI to resolve the issue quickly. AI can quickly show the agent the actual location of your customer, the location of the nearest tow truck and the time it will take the tow truck to arrive. It can also notify the tow truck, show the agent the location of the nearest clinic in case the customer needs medical assistance, saving your agent the time to manually look for the information and make the necessary calls. As a result, you can provide your customer with real-time assistance.</p>



<h3>3. Getting Smart </h3>



<p>Smart watches, smart cars, smart TVs, and other smart
devices continue to have a mammoth impact on consumer-oriented experiences.
Companies are building customer experiences around smart connected devices and
reshaping customer expectations in the process. The effect in the B2B segment
will be just as remarkable and will go beyond the automatic or single-tap
wireless updating of software features and bug fixes. </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>For most people, the best customer experience would be one that provides problem resolution without them having to know about it. Otherwise, one where the device notifies customer service based on a data trigger, empowering the user to help solve the issue on his terms.</p>



<p>As we shoot up the connectivity, contact center agents and technicians will increasingly interact not only with people but also with a wide range of devices, requiring these experts to hone their skills to handle different questions and complex situations.</p>



<h3>4. Big Data Getting Bigger</h3>



<p>Considering the ABI Research <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240227341/IoT-enabled-devices-to-cross-40-billion-by-2020">report</a>
that IoT/M2M will reach 40 billion in 2020, it is safe to say that connected
devices will soon outnumber people 5:1 or more. And they will generate a lot of
data.&nbsp; To deliver excellent customer
service businesses has to process this data to put the right information into
the right Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>At present customer service agents get access to just the performance information and customer data available in the CRM. That is a small slice of data that is often segmented. To use big data to its full potential, businesses have to analyze all data points and spread it across an organization along with other data. AI, data science, and machine learning can help you with that. </p>



<p>These advanced technologies will help you process big data faster, analyze the data to get better understanding of your customers and their expectations and using the same for future customer interactions. They will help agents get the full picture and deliver faster resolution, create more upsell/cross-sell opportunities, and ultimately deliver a superior customer experience.</p>



<p>Smartphones, 5G, devices, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wearable-technology-change-face-customer-service-kishore-saraogi/">wearables</a>, as well as big data, will continue to bring positive changes in customer service. Is your customer service ready to deliver new customer experience? </p>

<p>You have been told that proactive chat is a great way to up the customer satisfaction level. However, proactive chats too can ruin otherwise good customer experience.</p>



<p>Here’s an example – while browsing a site the live chat agent starts an interaction with you stating its various products and features that are already given on the webpage and do not give you a chance to convey what you are looking for. How would you feel then? </p>



<p>It is natural to get annoyed at such behavior. Proactive chat
only enhances the customer experience when it is used the way it is supposed
to.&nbsp; Your agents must know what works the
best and what does not.&nbsp; To save you the
time, Fusion brings you the best tips and tricks to turn a bad online
experience into a winning one.</p>



<h2>1. Leverage analytics to find the right time</h2>



<p>The key to <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">providing quality customer service through proactive chat</a> is using the analytics to your benefit. You can use analytics to determine many factors like:</p>



<ul><li>Average browsing time of a visitor.</li><li>His/her behavior for every page of the website.</li></ul>



<p>Based on the information gathered through analytics, you can
decide the appropriate wait time for sending out a proactive message.</p>



<h2>2. Track referring URLs</h2>



<p>In the present age, your work does not end after placing promotional links at different places online, you need to also keep track of its aftermath.  Tracking referring URLs can create great conversion opportunities. You must identify the users who came to your website through the referral links and send out proactive chat invitations to them.</p>



<p>In case they came to your site grab some promotional offers featured on the referring website, a proactive chat is the best way to direct them to the offer page. Proactive chat can also be used to resolve any other query they might have regarding the offer. </p>



<h2>3. Provide 24/7 customer support</h2>



<p>Customers these days expect instant query resolution. Moreover, they expect round the clock support 365 days a year from you.  You must be there to guide/assist them at any point of the day.  And that means having some proven customer touch points on a 24/7 basis.  These touch points include email, VOIP channels, social media platforms, live chat and more.</p>



<p>In this situation, proactive chat can be your best option &#8211; it helps help you to know your potential customers and their queries before they approach you and provide the most satisfactory solution. </p>



<h2>4. Use proactive chat tools for smarter communications</h2>



<p>As visual learners, your customers will learn better when you
explain you explain facts about your products and services through demos. You
can use this to your advantage and employ tools like live voice chat, live
video chat to educate them.&nbsp; You can also
redirect your customers to relevant pages using co-browsing or proactively
offer them links to support videos through chat.</p>



<p>These tips can help you improve your lackluster proactive chat
support into an effective tool to improve customer satisfaction. </p>

<p>Customer experience is the need of the hour. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-quick-tips-can-improve-your-customer-experience-instantly.html">Great customer experience can make your customers happy</a> and happy customers result in more business.  That is why more and more businesses these days are trying to provide their customers with state-of-the-art customer service. </p>



<p>Today when the customers expect nothing but the best
treatment from the company, the standard customer service cannot offer the same
level of satisfaction. For that, you need to shift from reactive to proactive
customer service.&nbsp; </p>



<h2>What is Reactive and Proactive Customer Service?</h2>



<p>Reactive customer service is when a customer has a question
while browsing your website, contacts you via different communication channels
and waits for a response. This is the standard customer service that most companies
provide. </p>



<p>Proactive customer service means anticipating customer
issues and addressing them proactively through a number of communication
channels (including forums, FAQs, knowledge base, and instructional videos).
Reaching out to your customers to inform them about a problem before they have
experienced it is an example of proactive customer service. Proactive customer
service has the power to get your customers live for your brand.</p>



<h2>Why is Proactive Support Important?</h2>



<p>Proactive customer support offers a number of benefits for
your business. These are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increase
customer loyalty</strong> – According to a report by <a href="https://medium.com/@Workato/what-role-will-ai-play-in-the-future-of-customer-service-7332a7e503b7">Enkata</a>
taking initiative in your support can boost customer retention rates by 3-5%.</li><li><strong>Decrease
support calls</strong> – Being proactive can help your business identify issues and
resolve them before they turn into problems, and thus can reduce the number of
tickets you receive.</li><li><strong>Take
charge of communication</strong> – By being proactive you can get involved in what
your customers are saying about your brand in private and on social media.&nbsp; You will also get a chance to engage with
them in a way that puts your business in a favorable light.</li><li><strong>Acquire
new customers</strong> &#8211; By being proactive you will get the opportunities to reach
out to prospective customers, and encourage them to switch to your brand.</li><li><strong>Retain
existing customers</strong> &#8211; When you proactively reach out to your customers, even
when they haven’t mentioned you directly, it deepens the relationship. With
social media customer service on the rage, you will need to go that extra mile
to exceed their expectations of good customer service. </li><li><strong>Create brand
advocates</strong> &#8211; Proactive customer service offers the chance to turn your
customers into brand advocates. &nbsp;Studies
show that a happy customer will tell at least 3 people about their experience.</li><li><strong>Protection
against escalation</strong> &#8211; You can avoid a social crisis by early identification
negativity surrounding your brand. </li></ul>



<p>This shows that proactive is the way to go for customer service.  While reactive customer service will cover your base, proactive customer service will take customer satisfaction and loyalty to a whole new level. According to a study by inContact, consumers were generally positive with proactive service. In fact, 87% of adults surveyed are happy to be contacted proactively by different companies regarding customer service issues. </p>



<h2>So How to Introduce Proactive Customer Service in Your Business? </h2>



<p>Here are a few easy tips:</p>



<h4>1. Ask for Feedback</h4>



<p>Customer service is about giving customers what they want. So, the first thing you have to do is to find out what they want. And the best way to do so is by asking them. If you check on your customers regularly, you may identify your weakness and correct them before your customers start to resent it. </p>



<h4>2. Announce Your Mistakes Before Customers Find Out</h4>



<p>Have you identified a problem in your product, service or
operations? It is better than your customers hear about it directly from you
instead of finding out themselves. Admitting your mistake, apologizing, fixing
the issue quickly, and/or offering a discount to compensate for their
inconvenience can help you earn your customer’s trust, avoid bad PR, and ensure
that the customers do not go anywhere.&nbsp; </p>



<h4>3. Reward Customer Loyalty </h4>



<p>Offering rewards for regular business is a good
loyalty-building tool. Loyalty programs demonstrate your company’s desire to
reward a customer as a token of thanks. You can proactively reach out to
customers with offers in between purchases. This can be a chance for positive
interaction with customers that strengthens their relationship with your
company. For example – you can send a discount voucher to your customers a
month before their subscription with you ends, compelling them to renew the
subscription. </p>



<h4>3. Pay Attention to What Your Customers Are Saying Online</h4>



<p>Pay close attention to what your customers are saying about
your brand online. If you reach out to customers who mentioned your brand in
their post, whether in a good context or bad, you will be able to address their
needs preemptively and increase their customer satisfaction.</p>



<h4>4. Create A Knowledge Base for Common Questions</h4>



<p>If you look carefully, you will find a set of common
questions that your customers frequently ask your customer support team or
search online. If you create a knowledge base where the answers to these
questions are provided, it will help your customers easily get their answers
without calling your customer service department. It will save time and bring
down the number of support calls. </p>



<h4>5. Introduce Live Chat</h4>



<p>Having a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="live chat (opens in a new tab)">live chat</a> on your website helps your customers resolve their queries while browsing your site. According to some, the ability to get answers from a live chat representative during an online purchase is among the most important features a business can offer. Proactively asking your customers if they need help through live chat can result in more business.</p>



<p>These are a few tips that can help your business adopt proactive customer service practices.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With customers today exposed the gold standard of customer service, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-quick-tips-can-improve-your-customer-experience-instantly.html">great customer experience</a> has become the need of the hour for businesses. You need to deliver nothing short of 5-star customer experience through every channel every single time.  </p>



<p><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">Live chat</a> has come across as an excellent customer interaction channel through which it is possible to deliver great customer experience. Want to know how? Here are nine easy steps to achieve excellence in customer experience:</p>



<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Make the Chat button visible</h3>



<p>Make sure that your customers can find that chat or contact
button easily on your website. If the customer has to look for it, it does not
amount to great customer experience. Setting up an automated and customized
message that engage your audience is a great way to get noticed. A prominent
and colorful chat now button will do the trick too.</p>



<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Don’t let the customer wait</h3>



<p>Once the chat starts do not let your customers wait for an
answer. The point of having a chat is not having to wait in a queue. Have your
live chat agents talk to a few visitors at a time. This way you will always
have somebody ready to chat.</p>



<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Personalize</h3>



<p>Personalizing results in great experience. You can use live
chat software that integrates with CRM to gather information about the customer
including their location, chat history, etc. The information will give you an
insight into the customer. You can also find important insight about the
customer from the notes made by you and your colleagues.</p>



<h3>Step 4 &#8211; Lend an Ear</h3>



<p>While chatting with a customer, live chat agents should be
more precise when providing solutions, as they have customers’ questions and
needs written in front of them. Listening to their problems first will help you
find a precise solution a lot quicker.</p>



<h3>Step 5 &#8211; Let the customer know if you need more time</h3>



<p>There will be times when a ready solution is not available.
So when you feel the need for some research or expert advice, communicate the
same to your customer. Give them a time frame and get back to the customer
within the timeframe. </p>



<h3>Step 6 &#8211; Take it easy on canned responses</h3>



<p>Use simple and clear language while talking with customers.
Having a personality while interacting via live chat will help you provide a
great experience to your customers. It is better to not use too many canned
responses. Use them only when you need to speed up the interaction while not
compromising with customer satisfaction.</p>



<h3>Step 7 &#8211; Empathy is everything</h3>



<p>Empathy is a must-have skill for everyone who wants to work
in customer support. Without the ability to imagine what the customers go
through and how does it make them feel, your reactions won’t be genuine.&nbsp; Knowing the situation, the customer is in
will help you find the solution fast.</p>



<h3>Step 8 &#8211; End a chat on a positive note</h3>



<p>You have probably heard the phrase – “<em>All’s well that ends well</em>”. It is true for your live chat interactions as well. The way you finish your interaction will have a lasting impression. If handled poorly, it can create a bitter memory for the customer. Ask customers if they’re satisfied with the solution you provided or whether there’s any part of the conversation that they didn’t understand and need further explanation.</p>



<p>Also, you need to ask if there’s anything else that they
need help with. You can end the chat with an intention to hear from them.
Saying this will remind them that you are there for them<strong>.</strong></p>



<h3>Step 9 &#8211; Follow up with a customer</h3>



<p>Do not forget to send a follow up to a customer -it is the best way to finish an amazing customer service. You can use email for the follow-up and ask if everything is working the way they should.</p>



<p>This way you can provide your customers with a great customer experience via live chat. </p>

<p>Businesses talk about quality customer experience. But are they really practicing what they preach? Let us look at the data:</p>



<p>According to Forrester&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/The+US+Customer+Experience+Index+2016/-/E-RES131003">2016 U.S. Customer Experience (CX) Index Report</a>, <em>consumers said that only 1 percent of U.S. businesses deliver excellent customer service</em>. The same research found that the state of customer experience stayed stagnant among Canadian businesses, and none of the U.K. companies received a top-rated score.</p>



<p>Clearly, with everyone talking about customer experience,
such a scenario was not expected. It clearly shows that most businesses are
either clueless about customer experience or are too lazy to go that extra mile
to give their customers a state-of-the-art experience. </p>



<p>Either way, it seems that the businesses have a lot to learn to improve customer experience. It will take many big and small changes to reach that place where they can <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/engage-your-agents-xfactor-quality-customer-experience.html">deliver top-class customer experience</a>. Here are a few quick-fixes that can help businesses improve their customer service in an instance.</p>



<h3>1. Say thank you to a power user</h3>



<p>Strengthening your relationship with your power users
sometimes means going offline. Take the time to understand how your product
fits into your customer’s life, recognizing them and appreciating their
business in a uniquely meaningful way will make them feel special.</p>



<h3>2. Personalize </h3>



<p>It has been a trend for many pizza shops to draw a picture
on the pizza box on personal request. Other businesses can take a lesson from
them and start entertaining personal requests on their packaging. While it
takes an extra minute or two, such personalization sends a clear message to
customers that they are seen and heard and that their decision to give you
their business is appreciated by you. </p>



<p>For example – you can ask for your customer’s choice about
how he wants to be addressed the first time he calls and use the same address
every single time. This is particularly important during the trial period.
Taking the time to connect with your customer on a personal level builds a bond
between the customer and the brand that the customer will remember when the
trial is over.</p>



<h3>3. Give away free stuff</h3>



<p>One of the surest ways to make customers happy is to give
them free stuff. But there is a difference between giving away useless stuff
and providing customers with added bonuses that add value to their life or to
their business. And do not forget to personalize the stuff. You see, not
everyone will find the same thing interesting.</p>



<p>Therefore, you should use a web personalization strategy to
help you determine the type of free offering you should offer to different
customer segments.</p>



<h3>4. Fix problems before they occur</h3>



<p>One way of creating outstanding customer experiences and
making customers happy is to solve your customer’s problems before they realize
they exist.</p>



<p>The idea is to stay one step ahead of the customer. It will
give you chance to solve problems proactively and create a flawless customer
experience. It also offers you ample scope of planning your customer outreach
and personalizing it.</p>



<h3>5. Fix your ineffective signup form</h3>



<p>Sign up forms are often among the first things you see when
visiting a product page for the first time. A lengthy form can send potential
customers back before you get the chance to explain what your product does.</p>



<p>Take time to re-evaluate your forms with the help of new and
existing users. Ideally, you should include their feedback to create a more
professional, comfortable experience. 

You can incorporate a few of these tips in your
customer experience to improve its quality instantly.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Are you looking for a Virtual Assistant?&nbsp; As you start getting busier, you require some
help in putting your things in order. In such a case a virtual assistant will
be the best aid at your disposal. A virtual assistant can be more than a pair
of hands to get your to-do list done – they will be an extension of you and
your business, ensuring better results.</p>



<p>But when you are hiring a virtual assistant service for the
first time, you need to create a handy virtual assistant checklist that will
help you find the right virtual assistant for your needs.</p>



<p>So, what should be in your hiring first virtual assistant
checklist? Let&#8217;s find out:</p>



<h2>Hiring Your First Virtual Assistant Checklist</h2>



<h3>1. Create a list of tasks you would like your virtual
assistant to perform</h3>



<p> Listing the tasks you want your virtual assistant to perform helps you create a job description for your own reference. On the other hand, it also allows your new virtual assistant to know what is expected of him or her. Noting down tasks that are taking up your time and would be better for someone else to do is the best way to begin your checklist.</p>



<p>For example, are you spending time posting blogs and doing its social promotion? Do you want your virtual assistant to take care of the incoming call? Jot them down on the list and soon you will find a comprehensive to-do list for your future virtual assistant.</p>



<h3>2. Consider language requirements: written and spoken</h3>



<p>We all know that communication, both spoken and written are
crucial to any business. Do you expect your virtual assistant to write or
proofread letters on your behalf? Do you want them to communicate with your
clients? Are they required or expected to know another language or languages
other than English?</p>



<h3>3. Do you want your virtual assistant to work in the same time
zone as yours?</h3>



<p>Depending on your job requirements, do you want your virtual
assistant to be available when you’re awake? Are you open to the idea that they
may be from a different time zone than yours? If you’re looking for a full-time
virtual assistant service, how many hours do you consider full-time? And while
you are at it, please also decide on working hours.</p>



<h3>4. What software skills must they have to do your work?</h3>



<p>Do you need jobs to be done using a specific software? Do
virtual assistants need to possess a set of must-have skills before they meet
the requirements to apply? For example, are they required to use Microsoft PowerPoint,
Excel, Word, or Photoshop to perform their tasks? Is there any particular
software knowledge required?</p>



<h3>5. Do they meet the needs for completing a trial task?</h3>



<p>Setup a trial task from one of the tasks you have listed in
your job description and get your virtual assistant to do this. It will either
help you make sure that you are getting the right person to do the job or make
you see why a particular candidate is not up to the mark.</p>



<h3>6. Increase the reach of your virtual assistant hire
search</h3>



<p>You can find virtual assistant services through a simple search online. A number of companies offer such services. Posting it on your website and spreading the news in online communities can also help you find the ideal virtual assistant. However please be sure to mention your budget and the skills you require to get better results.</p>



<p>At Fusion, we have <a href="http://www.supportsave.com/virtual-assistant-services.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="state-of-the-art virtual assistant services (opens in a new tab)">state-of-the-art virtual assistant services</a> that help small and medium business owners and individuals find their ideal virtual assistants.

		<title>8 Ways To Reduce The Response Time Of Social Customer Service</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Social customer service is an important tool to build
customer experience, drive loyalty, enhance brand reputation and lower
operational expenses by reducing the volume of customer service calls.&nbsp; However, in order to successfully cater to
your customers through social customer service you need to offer quick response
and resolution. </p>



<p>Exposed to the gold standard of customer service, consumers
today want answers to their queries and resolutions to their issues and they
want it right now. They do not have time to wait for a day to get a response of
an email or to wait in an IVR queue to talk to another human. In such
situations social customer support can come to the company’s rescue.&nbsp; When done rightly the personal, knowledgeable
and helpful nature of social customer service can not only resolve customer
issues pronto but can also drive better customer experience and boost brand
reputation.</p>



<p>But the question is, how can a brand with limited resources,
small teams, and isolated departments (CRM, helpdesk, customer support, and
social) deliver faster and more effective customer care interactions via social
media? Here are a few tips:</p>



<h3>1. Show the human face of your company</h3>



<p>Your customers prefer interacting with other people, not
automated systems. Social customer care agents can quickly connect with
consumers on a personal level by showing empathy for the consumer and their
issues.&nbsp; And thus, they create the opportunity
to diagnose an issue further, leading to quicker resolution. This also improves
your brand perception.</p>



<h3>2. Acknowledge pronto</h3>



<p>It is possible that a social customer care agent may not
have all the answers or that resolving the issue requires the customer to be
redirected to another department or channel (for due to personally identifiable
information requirements or other sensitive information), the agent must let
the customer know that they are on the care and the brand cares for its
customers. Customers today are willing to wait a little if the company
acknowledges their requests or issues. </p>



<p>In case an issue cannot be resolved right away, the agents
should provide the customer with a timeframe and stick to it. A little delay
here and there is okay but do not go a whole day past the deadline to provide a
response.&nbsp; This way your company can lose
their precious goodwill.</p>



<h3>3. Don’t compel customer to change the channel unless absolutely necessary</h3>



<p>Customers today prefer to get a response to their issue in
the same channel through which they interacted with the company regarding the
issue.&nbsp; While there are times when
conversations need to be taken offline, businesses should attempt to respond to
issues publicly through the same channel where the inquiry is made. Pushing your
customers from one channel to another is never a good idea. This leads to
confusion and frustration and increases the resolution time significantly.</p>



<h3>4. Clearly mention operating hours</h3>



<p>If you can’t provide 24-hour social care support, have the information clearly listed across all channels. Better still <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com">hire a BPO for managing your social customer care</a> during the non-operational hours.  If that is not an option for you, make sure to list other communication channels of your brand, as well as links to other useful information, FAQs, easy-fix videos, and much more.</p>



<h3>5. Get the right for the right job</h3>



<p>Your social care team should be armed with the right tools
and training, and tested against any type of scenarios. You can either integrate
social experts into the traditional call center or transition and train members
of the call center for social response. Availing the social customer care
services from a reputed BPO can also be a solution. However, be sure to have a
tight integration between your inhouse customer service team and the outsourced
ones. This will help you identify mass issues quickly by addressing your
customers through proactive posts and messages across all communication
channels. It will also reduce the response time and volume of inquiries through
social and traditional channels. </p>



<h3>6. FAQs and pre-approved information</h3>



<p>If you analyze the queries carefully, you can always find a
list of questions that are repeated time and again across all channels. You can
easily develop a list of these FAQs with their responses, get it approved and
keep it stored in a content library for quick distribution. This will help you
in reducing the social care response time and costs and improve the efficacy of
your social care team.</p>



<h3>7. Know the Customers</h3>



<p>Knowing your customers and understanding their value to your
company can help you prioritize responses and decide the way some individual
cases are handled. A customer with a wide social footprint, or a brand advocate
with deep knowledge about your product should get a priority treatment.&nbsp; Therefore, social care agents must look for
social profile information of a customer before responding. </p>



<p>However, you must also know the time when most of your
customers are active on social media and manage your workforces accordingly to
provide quick and efficient resolutions to all your customers. The response
provided to all customers should be prompts, personalized with thoughtful in
order to increase their satisfaction level.</p>



<h3>8. Get Right Tools</h3>



<p>You need to have the right tools and technology in place for more effective and efficient care. With the use of monitoring, categorization, filtering and automated routing, together with approval workflows and measurement as well as reporting capabilities social care efforts can be speeded up and improved.</p>



<p>Like all customer service channels social customer service too needs to be managed quickly and thoughtfully. If you do not speed up the response times, or leave questions unanswered your customers will feel devalued and frustrated and will vent their annoyance in public. Therefore, bad social customer service is worse than having no social customer service at all. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gone are the days when voice calls were the only mode of
communication with a company, and customers had to wait a long time to speak to
a customer service agent.&nbsp; Today, we not
only have numerous communication channels but also have the capability to
initiate communications through such a wide variety of channels from a handheld
device – a smartphone, or tablet. </p>



<p>&nbsp;Today <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/shopping-lists-how-mobile-helps-consumers-tick-all-the-boxes.html">87%</a>
of customers actually use mobile devices to make purchases. &nbsp;However, many businesses are yet to join the
mobile customer service bandwagon. That is not only making their customers
suffer but also is killing the business slowly. With most customers moving on
to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, every customer-facing business
should also be there to provide an excellent and easy-to-use mobile customer
experience.</p>



<p>To provide your customers with a great<a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-omnichannel-customer-service-best-practices-to-boost-customer-experience.html"> customer experience through mobile</a>, you need to understand what customers want. The <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/provide-quality-customer-service-to-the-millennials.html">millennials</a>, the segment of customers with the highest purchasing power, value timely service through the channel of their choice. They also prefer self-service over waiting in the call queue. They are a tech-savvy generation who put much emphasis on ease-of-use and seamless experience. </p>



<p>Keeping these in mind, you should make necessary amends to
your customer service strategies so that it can improve the customer experience
for the mobile-savvy customers. Here’s how you can improve your customer
service via mobile:</p>



<h3>1. Offer
Mobile-friendly self-service materials</h3>



<p>Customers today prefer self-service over everything else.
Being tech-savvy, they can easily resolve their issues through self-service. &nbsp;Therefore, a company should offer ample
self-service materials i.e. mobile-friendly FAQs, documentation and
self-support videos to its mobile-savvy clients.</p>



<h3>2. Display your
customer service button prominently </h3>



<p>Your mobile website or app landing page must have a customer
service button in a place where everyone can find it. Having a prominent
customer service button saves your customers from the hazard of searching for
your customer service number through the tiny screen. It also saves your
customers’ time and improves customer experience.</p>



<h3>3. Provide an easy
way to contact customer support from the mobile without leaving the page</h3>



<p>If a customer has a query regarding one of your products while visiting your website or app via mobile, they should not have to leave the page to communicate with customer support. A prominent, but non-intrusive <em>dial-for-support</em> or<em> live-chat-for-support</em> button can be placed on the website or app allowing your customers to communicate with you without leaving the page. This way, they do not need to remember the product number or other details related to their query and can simply convey them to the customer service agent by looking at the screen.</p>



<h3>4. Single-tap
sensitive customer service links </h3>



<p>Whether you have a mobile app or a mobile-friendly website,
you should always prominently feather customer service links on them.&nbsp; And that link should be single tap sensitive
so that your customers can have access to your customer service department at
the single tap of a link. Remember, in the mobile era, convenience and time
matters above all else. Therefore, a single-tap sensitive customer service link
can be an important step towards improving your customer experience. </p>



<h3>5. A real-time
tracking system for mobile-based customer service queries</h3>



<p>Using a real-time tracking system for mobile-based customer
service queries can be a useful tool to improve customer experience through
outstanding customer service.&nbsp; With the
help of this, you can centralize every customer support requests and queries so
that your agents do not have to log into multiple accounts to answer the
questions. It is also possible to prioritize important questions to be answered
first. This way, you can offer your customers great customer service experience
and track agent productivity at one go.</p>



<p>These are some of the easiest ways to improve your customer
service to adapt to the changing habits of your mobile-savvy customer base.</p>

<p>You have all heard about <em>Powerpuff Girls</em> and how they are made of sugar &amp; spice and all things nice and an accidental dose of chemical X. Without that chemical X or X factor, they would become powerless.  The same thing applies for excellent customer service.  No matter how you incorporate the latest technology, metrics, and communication channels to provide the best customer service through your contact center, it will be quite useless without the factor X – your agents. </p>



<p>The agents are often the unsung heroes of customer service.
They work as the first point of contact for your customers and therefore has
the power to build or ruin a customer experience. According to a study,
companies with engaged employees outperform those without by up to <a href="https://www.business2community.com/business-innovation/remote-workforce-nps-important-metric-youre-missing-01785305#oWRIA4bsxOwz6011.97">202%</a>.
Want to deliver excellent customer experience every single time?&nbsp; Turn your attention to engaging your agents. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/employee-engagement-statistics.jpg" alt="Employee Engagement Statistics" class="wp-image-6395" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/employee-engagement-statistics.jpg 468w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/employee-engagement-statistics-300x238.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></figure></div>



<p>At Fusion, we take agent engagement very seriously and
perform various activities to keep our agents engaged, encouraged and
empowered. Here are a few agent engagement tips that Fusion regularly uses to
keep the agents engaged:</p>



<h3>1. A Sincere thanks </h3>



<p>A little thank you can go a long way. After a successful
campaign or an exhaustive week, a thank you can pick the agents up like nothing
else. We recommend that every manager must have it in their arsenal and use it
regularly.</p>



<h3>2. Training</h3>



<p>The training and orientation program at the beginning of an
agent’s tenure in your organization is often exhaustive.&nbsp; There’s a lot to take in within a short
period. Therefore, some agents tend not to remember each and everything taught
at the initial training.&nbsp; To fix this,
Fusion arranges custom training for them that help them catch up and improve
their performance. </p>



<p>Fusion also arranges cross-trainings with a goal of
increasing employee knowledge. We have them trained in other departments or
positions, help them learn new skills and languages.&nbsp; It provides a sense of value to an employee
and puts them on a fast track for improvement.</p>



<h3>3. Offsite events </h3>



<p>Everyone needs to break their mundane cycle and let their
hair down every once in a while. And that is exactly what your agents need.
Take the team out of the office and have some fun. Take them on a picnic, a
happy hour, an after-office badminton session, or a football tournament. Allow
them to have fun and enjoy each other’s company. Your team deserves this. </p>



<h3>4. Communicate
expectations and reward the efforts</h3>



<p>As the old saying goes – “<em>Tell me and I forget; show me and I remember; involve me and I understand</em>” you need to involve your agents and show them the big picture.  This way, the agents will know what is expected from them and how they can drive the company towards success. And when they meet that expectation, do not forget to recognize their efforts, encourage them, and reward them. This means the world to them. </p>



<h3>5. Reward and
recognitions</h3>



<p>Provide incentives and praise. It really shows agents how
much the organization respects and values them and their critical role. This
way you will inspire agents to keep doing the kinds of things that increase
customer satisfaction and boost customer experience. </p>



<p>Also, your reward should not come in the form of a cupcake,
pizza, and balloons.&nbsp; They do not quite
convey the message that you value your agents. Fusion has a few suggestions: </p>



<ul><li>A Wall of Fame featuring agents who have achieved excellence in key areas last month</li><li>A points-for-performance program, where agents who excel receive points that can be redeemed for merchandise</li><li>Peer recognition such as “<em>You rock!</em>” stickers or a pack of chocolates to peers who show outstanding effort in making a customer happy. </li><li>Honoring agents during Customer Service Week, and other such recognition.</li><li>Rewarding the best performers quarterly in a small ceremony where the CEO congratulates them can be great.</li></ul>



<h3>6. Ask for agent
feedback</h3>



<p>You must make your agents feel valued and heard.&nbsp; Therefore, you need to ask for their opinion,
suggestions, and feedbacks. This also has other advantages. Often agents can
notice common issues and come up with easy solutions. Their feedback can help
your business resolve underlying issues.&nbsp;
All employees need to feel valued and believe they have a say in the
future of the business. 

These are a few tried and true agent engagement
tips that Fusion has put to work with brilliant results.&nbsp; Do you have such tips? Share with us in the

<p>Gone are the days when retail businesses were purely
brick-and-mortar. Thanks to new technology, the rise of internet and the
changes in the spending habits of its consumers, retail industry went through
some drastic changes in recent years. </p>



<p>And as the boundaries between retail and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/ecommerce.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ecommerce (opens in a new tab)">ecommerce</a> are blurring, consumers’ expectations from a retail business is growing dramatically. Consumers today expect service from a wide variety of channels from a retail business including in-store, online, and over the phone. This has increased the challenges for retail businesses all around.</p>



<p>To meet these ever-growing challenges and succeed, retail
businesses can get help from call center outsourcing. In fact, hiring a call
center can have multiple benefits for a retail business.&nbsp; Here are they:</p>



<h3>1. Provide Better
Customer Support</h3>



<p>Retail businesses can provide better service for their
customers by taking a proactive approach and using multiple channels. &nbsp;With an outsourced call center that is
designed and equipped to handle a variety of customer issues, the process of
customer service becomes much more efficient. Also, the likelihood of customer
problems or complaints being resolved quickly is much greater with a
professional call center. When customers feel satisfied with the support, it creates
greater loyalty which can translate into future sales.</p>



<h3>2. Meet Customers on
Their Terms</h3>



<p>When a customer has a problem, issue, or question, they want
to be able to receive service immediately. To meet that expectation, retail
businesses need to provide 24/7 service through a variety of communication
channels, which is something that call centers can make possible.</p>



<h3>3. Increase Brand
Presence</h3>



<p>In today’s business world, reaching customers and increasing your brand presence needs to include a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/how-to-change-into-a-multi-channel-call-center-tips.html">multi-channel approach</a>. Call center services use a variety of channels (as voice, e-mail, live-chat and a variety of social media platforms) to increase awareness about your business and raise your retail presence. Equipped to handle so many channels, the contact center can handle multiple customer queries across every available channel your customer uses.</p>



<h3>4. Boost Customer
Experience</h3>



<p>By using call center services, a retail business can reach the right customer, through the right channel, with the right message at the right time and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-ways-to-boost-customer-experience-through-call-center.html">offer greater customer experience</a>. Also, timely customer service round the clock means better customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>



<h3>5. Provide Big Data
Collection and Analysis</h3>



<p>Call center technology provides clear metrics and data
analysis in real time. Call centers can quickly provide feedback on data that
would need to be measured. This type of data collection and analysis enables
the retailer to make required adjustments to make the business successful. </p>



<h3>6. Allow Businesses
