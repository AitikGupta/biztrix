<p>Great customer service is the need of the hour. If as an
organization you cannot provide good customer service you are sure to lose
their loyalty at some point in time. Therefore, you need to provide the best
possible service to your customer.</p>



<p>While every business today tries to <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html">provide excellent customer service</a> and reduce the customer effort with timely and effective support to improve their experience, it fails to recognize the most important aspect of delivering a customer experience – their employees who serve in a customer facing role. </p>



<p>If you make it difficult or the employees to do their job,
it will translate to the experience they deliver to your customers.&nbsp; Even if the difficult task is not directly
related to the customer, the frustration of doing that task somehow impacts the
employee-customer interaction. Also, it gradually makes your employees <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/reasons-and-remedies-of-employee-disengagement.html">disengaged</a>
resulting in an even poorer customer experience. Yet according to a CCW 2019 <a href="https://www.customercontactweekdigital.com/content-auto-download/5be9b822d1d92e406f3b64d1">study</a>,
most companies do not pay as much attention to reducing employee effort as they
do to personalization. </p>



<p>At Fusion, we give our employees utmost importance and
recognize their unique position in delivering a good customer experience. Therefore,
we always ask ourselves the following questions:</p>



<ul><li>What&#8217;s keeping employees from delivering the
great experience that your customers deserve?</li><li>Is there a way to simplify workflows and
processes?</li><li>How can we make it easier for employees to do their
job?</li><li>How do we make it easier for agents to deliver a
great customer experience by removing complexities, complications, and
bureaucracy?</li><li>Are there ways to reduce effort for employees
and ultimately, for customers?</li></ul>



<p>With our vast experience in the customer service industry,
we have found that making necessary changes to reduce the efforts of your employees
leads to improved customer experience. Here are a few suggestions on how to
turn things around for our employees, and eventually, for the customer.</p>



<h3>1. Walk In Your Employees&#8217; Shoes</h3>



<p>Walking in your employees’ shoes in the best way to
understand the effort they put every day. To do this, you can create any of the
two following things: </p>



<ol><li>Employee journey maps</li><li>Your own undercover executive program, in which executives take on the role of the employee. </li></ol>



<p>Once you understand the effort, you&#8217;ll be able to unearth
the inefficiencies and ready to improve the process. At Fusion, we have used
undercover executive program to see whether the employees are finding it easy
to do their job.</p>



<h3>2. Pay Attention To What Your Employees Are Saying</h3>



<p>Listen to what your employees are telling you. Watch them
work. If they say a process is difficult or pointless, you need to look into it
and fix it the best way you can. Ignoring it is not a wise decision.</p>



<h3>3. Ensure Employees Have The Right Tools</h3>



<p>When you define employee roles and expectations, make sure
that your employees have the knowledge, skills, training, and resources
required to do the job. &nbsp;Without the
right tool, training and knowledge they will not be able to provide prompt and
to-the-point solution to your customers, resulting in a poor customer
experience. </p>



<h3>4. Reduce Their Effort With Modern Technology </h3>



<p>At Fusion, we believe in providing our employees with the
most modern tools that make their jobs easier and less time consuming. For
example – if customer service agents get <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">AI
assistance</a> that brings all the data related to a customer on a single
dashboard, it helps them serve the customer better. Having an <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/benefits-of-adopting-omnichannel-customer-support.html">omnichannel</a>
environment makes it easier for the agents to ask suggestions of other agents
without putting the customer on hold and thus it reduces the agent effort and
ultimately the customer effort as well.</p>



<h3>5. Define The Idea Of A Great Customer Experience </h3>



<p>Giving your employees a clear idea about your customers will
help them understand what needs to be done. Defining the idea of a great
customer experience to them will give them a clear target and help them
understand how to get there. </p>



<h3>6. Provide Ongoing Feedback</h3>



<p>Giving your employees regular feedback and ongoing coaching provides
them with the guidance they need to follow the right path, to do things in a
better manner and to do it right every single time. Just like employee feedback
helps create a better process, giving regular feedback and training to the
employees help them deliver a better customer experience. According to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/11-employee-feedback-statistics">Hubspot</a>,
regular employee feedback can greatly impact employee engagement.</p>



<p>These are some useful tips that can help you reduce agent effort, root out the inefficiencies, and create a streamlined and simpler work process that makes the job easier for the employees. A simpler work process with the right tools and technology result in a better customer service while regular feedback and timely training boosts employee engagement. As a result, your employees are happy and your customers are happier.</p>



<p>Fusion has always been an advocate of reducing employee efforts and engaging them with timely feedback and training. We feel that when our agents are engaged, they provide a far more efficient customer support that boosts customer satisfaction. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With self-service on the rise, many people believe that the
time is up for live human agents who have been the backbone of call center and
customer service industry. Fusion respectfully begs to differ. </p>



<p>Having more than 15 years of experience in the call center
industry, we have studied consumer behavior closely. And while customer support
has changed a lot over the years thanks to technological advancements like
self-service and AI, live agents still remain the most preferred choice for
customer support, especially in the complex cases. </p>



<p>Here are a few of our observations on the role of live
agents in the modern customer service industry:</p>



<h3>1. People Still Want To Interact With A Human Agent</h3>



<p>Customer service encounters through social media or self-service don’t always leave customers feeling great confidence. On the other hand, interacting with a fellow human can make your customers feel reassured. </p>



<p>Even the tech-savvy <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/provide-quality-customer-service-to-the-millennials.html">millennials</a> who prefer self-service and other technology-rich customer service channels, resort to interacting with live customer service agents via voice or <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">chat</a> when they face a complex issue.  </p>



<p>Therefore, live agents are still very much relevant in the modern customer service scene and if anything, they play a far more significant role today than the role it used to play earlier.</p>



<h3>2. Customers Want Easy Access To Live Agents</h3>



<p>No matter how technologically advanced a call center becomes, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/engage-your-agents-xfactor-quality-customer-experience.html">there is no alternative of human agents</a>.  Even today, customers are more comfortable to convey their unique issues to a human agent than to a chatbot or IVR. Therefore, customers must be given the choice to talk to a live human agent and the option should be clearly conveyed to the customer. Many businesses these days think so as well.</p>



<p>In the Customer Contact Week Digital market study, <a href="https://www.customercontactweekdigital.com/content-auto-download/5be9b822d1d92e406f3b64d1">64%</a> of respondents agreed that customers must have easy access to a live human agent.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY.jpg" alt="THE FUTURE OF THE CONTACT CENTER IN 2019" class="wp-image-6593" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY.jpg 801w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-300x285.jpg 300w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-768x729.jpg 768w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-750x712.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></figure>



<p>As a call center with over 15 years of experience, Fusion has also seen that a customer is far more comfortable in discussing their issues with a human agent than telling it all to a faceless machine entity. They crave for the empathy that only a live human agent can deliver.</p>



<h3>3. Live Agents Can Handle Complex Issues Better</h3>



<p>All the issues handled by customer service can predominantly
be classified into two groups –</p>



<ul><li>Simple issues or inquiries </li><li>Complex problems</li></ul>



<p>Simple issues can be defined as issues that can be handled
within a single interaction or a basic issue reporting that can be resolved by
the company without additional customer input. These issues generally are
frequent and reoccurring and therefore, addressing them with automated channels
like knowledge-based systems, social media, improved website forms, text
messages, and chat systems makes complete sense. </p>



<p>However, when the problem is complex, automated channels fail to effectively resolve them. For this reason, most complex issues are handled over the phone.</p>



<p>It takes more time to explain the problem in detail so that the customer service agent can understand it, analyze it, and work on providing the resolution. However, the process can be improved by integrating AI with human agents.</p>



<h3>4. Artificial Intelligence Should Complement Human Agents Instead Of Replacing Them</h3>



<p>While <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Artificial Intelligence (opens in a new tab)">Artificial Intelligence</a> or AI is the buzzword in modern customer support, it is still not in a position where it can replace a human agent. AI is to go a long way before it can master the art of natural language processing (NLP) and empathy. Instead, it can be used to aid a live agent and make their job easier.  </p>



<p>For example – if one of your customers has an issue
regarding their bills, a live agent will take some time to find relevant
information. &nbsp;When AI is brought into the
scene, it will be able to show the agent the past interaction history on the
screen along with itemized billing so that it becomes easier for the agent to
promptly resolve the issue and ask about the previous issue the customer
faced.&nbsp; It will up the customer
satisfaction level.&nbsp; </p>



<h4>Conclusion: </h4>



<p>Human agents were, are, and will be occupying the central position of the customer service industry.  The chance of AI replacing live agents looks very slim in the near future as AI needs a lot of improvement to be at par with a human agent in terms of emotional intelligence. </p>

<p>Even when people know what they are looking for while
shopping, they still may need some assistance for locating them in a
store.&nbsp; And it is not only brick and
mortar store we are talking about, people need ready assistance while online
shopping as well. </p>



<p>According to a study conducted by <a href="http://www.roosit.nl/files/en/documents/Forrester_making_proactive_chat_work.pdf">Forrester Research</a>, 44% of online consumers say that having questions answered by a live person while in the middle of an online purchase is one of the most important features a website can offer.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chat_work.png" alt="Customer Experience Online Survey" class="wp-image-6416" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chat_work.png 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chat_work-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption><em> Live Help Is One Of The Most Important Features A Site Can Offer To US Online Consumers</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>While waiting on a call queue is something customers are not
fond of, communicating with your customer support team via Live chat is
something customers find convenient. It offers your customers a solution to
resolve their queries at the right time without having to leave the page they
are currently viewing.</p>



<p>An advance live chat facility can help you boost your customer experience and drive more sales. The process can also be outsourced easily without hampering the quality of customer experience. A <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/live-chat-support-benefits-every-business.html">quality live chat support</a> must have the following features.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Screen
sharing:</strong> With screen sharing the agent gets temporary access to a
customer’s computer screen and he can navigate on behalf of the customer. It is
easier and simpler way to assist the customer in situations where the customer
is not tech-savvy.</li><li><strong>Co-browsing:</strong>
When the customer is having difficulty placing an order online, the agents can
show how to use the ordering pages with the help of Co-browsing.</li><li><strong>Instant
Messaging:</strong> Instant messaging will help a customer get prompt answer to
their queries, speeding the purchasing process.</li><li><strong>Video
Conferencing:</strong> video conferencing can help you serve a priority customer
better. It calls for better customer experience and more personalized support.</li><li><strong>Calling
Facilities:</strong> Having a calling facility in the live chat support can provide
your customer an opportunity to talk to a live agent making the experience
better.</li></ul>



<p>However, rich features alone cannot create a great chat
support experience for the customers.&nbsp;
For that you need to follow a few live chat best practices.&nbsp; Want to know about them? Check them out:</p>



<h3>1. Make the Most out
of Canned Messages</h3>



<p>By using canned messages, customer service agents can greet
customers fast without having to type it all.</p>



<h3>2. Collect
Information</h3>



<p>Use pre-chat surveys to know the issues your customers have
before they begin typing. Set a routing rule based on this information so that
the chat goes to the right department or agent.</p>



<h3>3. Practice Using
Shortcuts</h3>



<p>Setting shortcut keys for frequently used operations, like
canned responses will help your agents save time. Fusion has successfully used
canned response for its live chat support services and significantly reduced
the Average Handling Time (AHT). </p>



<h3>4. Use Alternate
Media</h3>



<p>You can also save time by sending images, files,
screenshots, or even how-to videos to customers instead of writing complex
responses.</p>



<h3>5. Be clear about Wait Time and Operation Hours</h3>



<p>If an issue cannot be resolved immediately, tell the
customer that and give them a clear wait time and stick to it. Also, if the
live chat support is available 24/7 say so, if not then mention that too. Your
website, social media profile should also have the operational hours mentioned
clearly.</p>



<h3>6. Personalize Your Chat</h3>



<p>Personalize your greeting and responses using the customer’s
name and buyer history. It is a great way to let your customers know that you
care about their unique issue. </p>



<h3>7. Build a Connection</h3>



<p>Use customer service representative names and photos to
build a rapport between your customer and the customer service representatives
at the beginning of the interaction.</p>



<h3>8. Acknowledge and
Empathize</h3>



<p>Being sensitive to your customers’ needs, acknowledging
their concerns makes the customers feel that your care for them and are not
trying to wrap it up quickly.</p>



<h3>9. Use the Right Tone
and Voice </h3>



<p>Your online live chat presence should reflect your brand
identity. Therefore, your chat must have a distinct tone or voice. For example
– a high-end fashion brand will have a different tone than a company selling
soccer merchandise. &nbsp;</p>



<h3>10. Be Positive</h3>



<p>Being positive and friendly in live chat can help you win
your customers over. 

These are the ten best practices for live chart
support your business must follow. In case you do not have the manpower and
budget to offer live chat support round the clock, you can hire a BPO that
offers live chat support as a service.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In recent years, the airlines industry has faced major
challenges like rising fuel cost, changes in environmental regulations, and an
ever-rising customer expectation. To cope with them, most airlines are looking
for ways to reduce cost while meeting the environmental regulations and
customer expectations. </p>



<p>In such a situation, business process outsourcing (BPO) can
offer the airlines industry fast and simple solutions that help small and
medium airlines survive the tumulus time and prepare them for future growth and
expansion. The BPO solutions include a number of benefits including cost
reduction, the biggest challenge for airlines these days. These are: </p>



<ul><li>Reduction of the cost structures and making it
transparent</li><li>Focus on the customers’ needs despite
cost-cutting</li><li>Customer retention</li><li>Better planning capacity and inventory
management based on hard data </li><li>Consolidation of delivery operations to
standardize business processes</li></ul>



<p>Thanks to the latest technological breakthroughs, BPOs today can provide a wide number of <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/travel-transportation-hospitality.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="custom solutions to the airlines industry (opens in a new tab)">custom solutions to the airlines industry</a>. From AI-assisted customer service to rescheduling, delays, and cancellation assistance, a modern BPO can handle it all.&nbsp; Some of the most popular processes that airlines are outsourcing to BPOs are:</p>



<p><strong>Ticketing</strong> – BPOs
are equipped to handle ticketing and reservation processes for airlines of any
size.&nbsp; </p>



<p><strong>Customer Service</strong>
– Customer service has been a forte of BPOs from the very beginning. With
AI-assistance, customer service agents are now better equipped to help the
customers faster and with increased efficiency.</p>



<p><strong>Online Payments Processing (Payment IVR) with Fraud Detection </strong>– Any <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/recognitions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="PCI-DSS certified BPO (opens in a new tab)">PCI-DSS certified BPO</a> can process online payment securely on behalf of an airline. From secure payment processing to fraud detection, everything is done with astute precision.</p>



<p><strong>Flight Information Services
and Inquiries</strong> – BPOs can easily handle flight information services and
inquiries in real time. </p>



<p><strong>Rescheduling,
Cancelling, and Delay Handling</strong> – From Rescheduling, cancellation, to delay
handling, a BPO can manage everything expertly without causing the slightest
problem to the customers.</p>



<p><strong>Lost Baggage Tracing and Customer Support</strong> – Lost baggage tracing can be quite frustrating to a customer. But the customer support experts in a BPO can handle the situation quite well, turning a negative experience into a positive one. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/will-ai-replace-or-enhance-a-call-center.html">With AI-enabled solutions, a BPO can provide effective customer support</a> that improves customer experience.</p>



<p><strong>Class Upgrades and Other
Services</strong> – Upselling and cross-selling are something BPOs are doing since
the very beginning. Therefore, airlines can always hire BPOs for class upgrades
and other related services.</p>



<p><strong>Loyalty Program Management
</strong>– BPOs can handle frequent flier loyalty programs for the airlines and help
them retain more customers.</p>



<p><strong>Campaign Management</strong>
– A well-executed sales campaign can help airlines attract new business or
enter a new market. And no one can manage a sales campaign better than a BPO. </p>



<p>By outsourcing these processes, airlines can bring
efficiency to its customer service and business processes and reduce the
operation cost simultaneously.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are the days when customers had to use a phone to communicate with a business. Today, we have numerous communication channels that can help a customer reach a business without having to spend time in the call queue. Among these channels, live chat is the most satisfying communication channel for over <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/live-chat-customer-support/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">73% </a>customers.</p>
<p>In this age of online shopping, many customers look for answers to their questions in real time with precision. To resolve this, many businesses have added live chat support that helps businesses provide an answer to customer questions in real time. Apart from that they also have quite a few benefits:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6329" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/live-chat-customer-support.jpg" alt="live chat is the most satisfying communication channel" width="600" height="342" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/live-chat-customer-support.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/live-chat-customer-support-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3>1. Convenient for Customers</h3>
<p>Many online consumers want help from a live person while they are shopping online. A study called “<a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/Making+Proactive+Chat+Work/-/E-RES57054" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Making Proactive Chat Work</a>” conducted by Forrester Research found that 44% of online consumers say that having questions answered by a live person while in the middle of an online purchase is one of the most important features a Web site can offer.</p>
<p>Live chat gives online customers an immediate access to help. Wait times are often significantly less than phone support, and customers can easily multi-task while waiting.</p>
<p>According to an ATG Global Consumer Trend <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20091007005074/en/ATG-Survey-Reveals-Two-Thirds-Online-Consumers-Live" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a>, 90% of customers consider live chat helpful. As per an eMarketer.com <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/How-Helpful-Live-Chat/1007235" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">survey</a>, 62% customers are more likely to purchase again from a site with live chat while 38% respondents said that they made the purchase because of the chat session.</p>
<h3>2. Cost-Effective</h3>
<p>While live chat software can be a considerable investment at first,  it will drastically lessen both employee task time and phone expenses. Live chat reduces contact center costs by lowering average interaction costs. It increases efficiency by allowing live chat agents to handle multiple chats simultaneously (4-5 chats), thus reducing the need to hire more.</p>
<p>With agents spending less time on the phone, they will be able to multi-task during chat conversations and cut the waiting queue to a bare minimum, thus increasing the chance of overall sales.</p>
<h3>3. Increases Sales</h3>
<p>To quote a <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/Case+Study+Wells+Fargo+Proves+The+Business+Case+For+Online+Chat/-/E-RES57154" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> by Forbes magazine &#8211; “<em>In 2008, Wells Fargo made a second attempt to leverage online chat to drive sales, and happily, this time the results have been crystal clear. High customer satisfaction scores and a double-digit increase in converted shoppers have shown the value once and for all of this technology</em>.”</p>
<p>The main aim of a live chat support is that customers should have someone who can help them during a purchase by answering their important questions and resolving their confusions regarding a product or service.  It helps eliminate bounces away from e-commerce websites and ensure that the products or services carts make it through check out.</p>
<h4>4. Gives You an Edge of Your Competition</h4>
<p>If you want to gain an edge on the competition, live chat is a necessary feature to add to your website.  Live chat provides a simple way to connect with customers who spend a good deal of their money online.  According to <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/How-Helpful-Live-Chat/1007235" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">E-Marketer</a>, “<em>Almost two in 10 live chat respondents did more than 75% of their holiday shopping online, compared with 14% of those who did not chat. A further 25% of chatters made 51% to 75% of their purchases on the Web, versus just 10% of those who did not participate in the chat service</em>.”</p>
<p>So, besides cost benefits, customer support, and increased sale, live chat support can help you book the top spot ahead of your competition.</p>
<h3>5. Access to Customer Pain Points</h3>
<p>A chat support is an excellent opportunity for a company to know the frustrations and needs that are yet to be filled. When customers use live chat, they’ll try to ensure that a product will perform as advertised or that a promotion will provide the discount they are looking for. In addition, as live chat agents talk to customers, they can find out how a customer wants to improve a company’s products and services.</p>
<p>These are some of the benefits a business can reap by incorporating live chat support on their website.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is one of the most popular channels for <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html" target="_blank">customer service</a>. It is also deemed to be the most difficult channel for customer service as well.</p>
<p>As social media brings a business in front of millions of customers and prospects, one wrong move from the company representative can cost the business a large number of customers and an even larger number of prospects. Surely we don’t want that, do we?</p>
<p>As social media enthusiasts from across the world are preparing to celebrate Social Media Day by the end of June, Fusion looks forward by sharing few useful few tips regarding social media customer service from its experiences as a customer service BPO.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Choose the right channels</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Facebook and Twitter are not the only two social media platforms available. There’s also Pinterest, Instagram, Youtube, Google+ and a host of <a href="http://www.sociableblog.com/category/social-media/" target="_blank">other platforms</a>. While Twitter, Facebook and Google+ give you the opportunity to express your thoughts via text, most other social media platforms do not have the facility.</p>
<p>For example, Instagram and Pinterest are image dominated while YouTube offers a platform to say it with videos. There are so many options. Therefore, take some time to decide your social media plan (text, video or image) and choose accordingly.</p>
<p>Also, do some research on where your customers are and opt for their preferred social media channel?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Define your company&#8217;s rules of engagement</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A business should always have a social media strategy, doing things haphazardly will make it worse. A business has to set up an alert to know every time someone mentions their brand online. This will keep you in the know about what is being said about your brand on social media.</p>
<p>Also checking those replies once in a day is not enough. You need to keep an eye on social media as often as possible. It should be like real time monitoring activity as the world is watching your brand name and protecting your brand name is very important.</p>
<p>Customer service over social media should be no different than that over the phone. Quick and real time response. And, for this reason, a business should entrust the call center with social media customer service.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Listen to customers first</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Millions of messages, images and videos are shared on the big social media platforms. So how will you know whether someone is talking about you? Setting an alert is a good option.</p>
<p>However, you may also opt for analytics, or make use of Facebook and Twitter’s search functionality complete with hashtags and @ mentions.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Respond promptly</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Responding within an hour of getting the message is acceptable, but if you reply after one whole day, you have made your customers very unhappy. And an unhappy customer may channel their righteous anger on different social media posts and cost you a few customers and prospects.</p>
<p>Even if a simple response like:– “<em>sorry for the inconvenience caused, our experts are looking into the matter. You will hear from us soon.</em>” Can calm an irate customer</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Don&#8217;t forget chivalry</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of dreading customer complaints, companies can turn them into opportunities to show their customer service values. By acknowledging and apologizing for mistakes, thanking the customer for the opportunity, companies can turn uncomfortable, potentially negative situations into opportunities to show their followers that they truly care.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong>Personalizing messages </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Automated and generic responses are easily spotted and can have a worse effect than not offering a response at all. On the other hand, personalized, unique interactions with customers on social media create stronger consumer/brand relationships.</p>
<p>A positive, friendly attitude with a little empathy, professionalism and courtesy on the part of the agent can do wonders.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h3><strong>Know your customers</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When possible, companies can link their CRM systems to their social media engagement platforms and identify customers on social media. They can then gauge the customers’ level of involvement, social influence, revenue potential, and overall value as a customer.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h3><strong>Make the post mobile friendly</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Pew Research, over <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-networking-fact-sheet/" target="_blank">40%</a> of all mobile users tend to access their social media accounts from their mobile, make sure to check whether the links that you have provided for their assistance are mobile friendly or not. They will appreciate your thoughtfulness.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<h3><strong>Post, don&#8217;t just reply</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Just posting replies for your fans is not enough. A business needs to be present on social media channels. Therefore, you should not only answer your customers’ queries but also involuntarily offer useful tips, share customer’s story and other materials that might help the customer.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<h3><strong>Make performance a priority</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not make fake promises on social media. Always deliver what you have promised promptly. Making performance a priority will give your business a reputation and help you gain the trust of your customers.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>
<h3><strong>Research their insight</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When your customers are posting queries, complaints or even feedback on social media, they are offering you valuable insights. These insights can act as the perfect research tool for you. Make productive changes in your end product/service based on the insight.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>
<h3><strong>Take the conversation offline</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If all fails, try to take the conversation offline. Asking for customer’s contact details and then calling him up is always helpful. It will take the conversation away from the public eye and pave the way for a personalized solution.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it will also make sure that if things go ugly the general social media user will not have to deal with the angry rant.</p>
<p>If you take care of these things, you are sure to deliver high-quality social media customer service to your customers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the consumers are becoming more tech-savvy, they are looking for alternative ways to reach a business &#8211; the ones that do not involve waiting in a call queue. Today, a large section of consumers prefer interacting with a business via email rather than over the phone.  In fact, email has become one of the fastest-growing customer service channels.</p>
<p>However, some customer service experts have <a href="http://www.stage2planning.com/blog/email-doesnt-replace-phones-customer-service" target="_blank">expressed</a> the concern that email customer support may lack the same level of interaction as talking to a live agent and may affect customer satisfaction. Fusion respectfully begs to differ.</p>
<p>We believe that when done right, email support can deliver the same level of customer satisfaction as phone customer support.  One just needs to get the basics right.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we keep in mind that though we deliver email support to a large number of customers every day, to a customer it is the only interaction they are having with our clients.  Therefore, every email should contain a sincere effort to resolve customer’s issues and deliver an impeccable customer service at the same times.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/what-is-the-best-time-to-send-a-b2b-email.html" target="_blank">What is the Best Time to Send a B2B Email?</a></p></blockquote>
<p>On this National Email Week, we share a few tips that we follow while delivering email support:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Always use correct spelling, grammar, punctuations and capitalization</strong>: Improper punctuation can change the meaning of a message completely. Misspelled words, poor grammar also reflects poorly on a business and its staff. There is no substitute for good writing in email customer service.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the tone conversational</strong>: Avoid sounding like an IVR and keep the language and tone of an email conversational. It will put the customers at ease.</li>
<li><strong>The agent should introduce themselves:</strong> Email support is above all a corporate interaction. Therefore, an agent answering an email should always introduce himself or herself at the beginning of the email just as they would have done in the case of an over-the-phone interaction.</li>
<li><strong>Narrate the solution in an easy-to-understand way:</strong> Make sure to explain the solution or the lack of it in an easy-to-understand manner so that everyone can get the message right. Avoid using technical jargons and uncommon abbreviations.</li>
<li><strong>Provide links to longer Instructions:</strong> In case there is a detailed instruction of a solution available, make sure to include a link to that page in your email. Also, links to additional documents, or digital version of any instruction manual that a customer might need can also be included in the email.</li>
<li><strong>Pay close attention to how you deliver good news and bad news:</strong> According to researchers at UC-Riverside, delivering the bad news first followed by the good news will make a customer happy.  But if a company wants a customer to act upon them, then the good news should be delivered first followed by the bad news.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:  In case there is no permanent solution to a problem, the email may read:</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, we are yet to find any permanent solution to the problem as of now, not that there is a lack of trying. However, there’s a way to fix the issue for the time being. </em></p>
<p>This approach will make the customer a lot happier than he is ought to be.</p>
<p>But if you want the customer to act (renew a subscription, upgrade account etc.), the email should deliver the good news first.</p>
<p><em>Great news, the feature that you are looking for exists.  Just upgrade to our premium package and get access to the feature.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replace the negative words with positive ones:</strong> Positive words have a powerful impact on customer satisfaction. Use them as much as possible and give the not-so-positive ones a miss.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Other ways to achieve better email customer support:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Respond to a request at the earliest:</strong> Keeping the customer waiting for a reply will lower their satisfaction level. Therefore, make sure to reply as quickly as possible. Replying immediately will show them that you are attentive to their problem and are taking it seriously.</li>
<li><strong>Solve the problem:</strong> just responding to an email is not enough.  You need to solve the problem the customer is facing ASAP.  If there is no ready solution, recognize that in your email and include a time-frame within which the problem will be resolved.</li>
<li><strong>Follow-Up: </strong>Even after a query or an issue is resolved; the company should send a follow-up email to ensure that everything is running smoothly.</li>
<li><strong>Deliver more than expected:</strong> An agent should go beyond the canned response and templates to help a customer. Include useful documents, element of surprise or a personal touch to make the customer feel special.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fusion encourages each of its agents to go that extra mile to bring a smile on the customers’ faces.  No matter what the customer channel is, we settle for nothing short of excellence.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The all new Tesla Energy comes with a majestic plan to power the world without making it more dependent on the grid. Tesla Energy has announced that a ten kilowatt-hour home battery called the <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Powerwall</a> will soon be available.</p>
<p>The big brother of the Powerwall is called the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/30/tesla-powerwall-battery_n_7186534.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Powerpack</a>.  Tesla explains it as an &#8220;infinitely scalable system&#8221; that can work for businesses, industrial applications, and even public utility companies. It comes in 100 kWh battery blocks that can range from 500 kWH up to 10 MWh and above.</p>
<p>And do you know the best part? All the energy is 100% responsibly sourced from a renewable resource – it is nothing but solar energy. There is no need to use exhaustible natural resources like coal and crude oil to generate power.</p>
<p>As a business process outsourcer, Fusion recognizes that the power solution will revolutionize the call center industry with a burst of clean energy.  Here, it shares a comprehensive list of the benefits of a Tesla Powerpack &#8211;</p>
<p><strong>Reduce Cost</strong> &#8211; What happens when a business does not have to depend on the grid during the peak consumption hours? With the Powerpack, any business can use electricity without having to worry about hefty bills. As a result, the cost of operation comes down. It is especially true for a call center that runs 24X7 and is always in need of electricity.</p>
<p><strong>Disaster Management</strong> – The all new power solution from Tesla can also come in handy in case a disaster, natural or manmade, takes place. With help of the Powerpack, a business can stay open even in such a situation. In case of medical institutions, insurance companies, and customer support industry this battery can be indispensable.</p>
<p><strong>Renewable Source</strong> – The all new Powerpack uses the sun as its energy source. Yes, the sun. So they do not have to worry about using up natural resources to generate power. The solar energy is a renewable resource that offers us clean energy every single day. The Powerpack just stores the solar power. It can be used even when the sun is not shining.</p>
<p><strong>Going Green </strong>&#8211; As this new power solution is nothing but a system of solar power storage; it is indeed a green energy solution. The sun is our prime resource of clean energy that is available across the world almost every day. Storing solar energy efficiently to power factories, call centers, data centers and much more can not only bring down the utility bills of a company but also the power will be responsibly sourced. It will help a company minimize their carbon footprints and do something for the environment.</p>
<p><strong>A Good Backup </strong>&#8211; Even if a consumer does not use solar power on a regular basis, the Powerpack, as well as the Powerwall can come in handy for them in case of a prolonged power outage. It is especially beneficial for the call center industry that serves its clients on a 24X7 basis.</p>
