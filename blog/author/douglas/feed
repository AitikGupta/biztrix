<p>In this competitive age, good customer
experience holds the key to customer loyalty.&nbsp;
In order to provide a good experience, businesses must focus on
delivering exceptional customer support that meets, if not overcomes your
customer’s expectations. </p>



<p>Customers today are exposed to the gold
standard of customer service. They are aware of their options and the power
they have. Therefore, they have high expectations from a business.</p>



<h2>So, What Does Your Customer Want?</h2>



<p>They want a company to promptly respond to
their queries and issues via the channel of their choice.&nbsp; If they wish to change the communication
channel, they should be able to do so seamlessly without having to repeat
themselves. </p>



<p>Today most of the companies provide customer support via a number of channels including <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/voice.html">voice</a>, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">chat</a>, email, social media, instant messaging, web, and mobile. However, the challenge is to integrate those channels for providing seamless interaction with consistent experience at multiple touch-points across the life cycle of a customer.  Such a feat is only achievable by adopting an omnichannel approach. </p>



<p>Fusion advocates <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="omnichannel customer support (opens in a new tab)">omnichannel customer support</a> to provide customers with a cohesive and integrated customer experience irrespective of where and how a customer chooses to reach you. Omnichannel customer support brings you a number of benefits. Here are the top benefits of adopting omnichannel customer support.</p>



<h2>Benefits of Omnichannel Customer Support &#8211;</h2>



<h3>1. Gain Greater Customer Insights</h3>



<p>Customer support channels such as chat, social media, forums, and emails, leave a recorded written customer trace. You can use this data to accumulate customer information in its context. It will help you better understand how the customers choose to interact with your brand and their needs across all channels.</p>



<p>Having this data in one place will enable you to take proactive actions and create effective strategies to tweak and enhance your customer support and deliver better customer experience.</p>



<h3>2. Serve Your Customers Where They Are</h3>



<p>Customers today want to make purchases on their own terms, at their convenience, and in a way that suits them the best. To build a sustainable business, you must satisfy your customers. That means you have to appeal to them wherever they are.</p>



<p>No matter what channel they choose to interact with you, you must provide seamless, cohesive support via the same. If the customer wishes to change their channel, they should be able to continue with the conversation across the channel as well.</p>



<p>Customers today are more powerful and aware
of the options they have. Therefore, they expect more from brands.&nbsp; They expect to get the best experience
wherever they are — whether online or offline. Providing it to them will not
only improve your conversion rate but will also increase a customer’s loyalty.</p>



<h3>3. Enhance the Shopping Experience Everywhere</h3>



<p>Your customer can choose to shop online,
in-app, or in a brick and mortar store, and still expect the same level of
customer experience. </p>



<p>For example – a customer looks for a product he has seen online at a brick and mortar store and the in-store representative finds the product out of stock.  He can then place an order for the same in their e-commerce store, to be delivered at the customer&#8217;s doorstep. </p>



<p>This way, omnichannel customer support can
enhance the shopping experience.</p>



<h3>4. Enhance Real-time Customer Support</h3>



<p>As customers’ demands are increasing by the day, businesses are making efforts to meet them. Customers want their needs to be met and they want it now. If you cannot deliver a real-time answer to their questions, or provide instant support, you are indirectly asking them to leave.</p>



<p>Real-time customer support boost customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. With <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-omnichannel-customer-service-best-practices-to-boost-customer-experience.html">omnichannel customer support</a>, it is possible to offer real-time support across a number of channels, creating a seamless customer experience.</p>



<h3>5. Happier, More Engaged and Loyal Customer</h3>



<p>When you have omnichannel customer support in place, your customers will be able to switch between channels seamlessly without feeling the frustration of having to repeat the issues. Also having up-to-date data in one place means faster resolution of issues. Such things definitely add to customer satisfaction rate and result in happier customers. Everyone knows that a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/start-by-keeping-your-customers-happy.html">happy customer</a> is the greatest thing for a business.</p>



<p>These are the vital benefits of adopting an omnichannel approach when it comes to customer service. By adopting an omnichannel approach you can enhance your customer experience, stay ahead of the competition with impeccable customer service, earn loyal and engaged customers who keep coming back, improving your business performance. </p>

<p>Chatbots have been on the rise since a couple of years and
have already gained popularity. Chatbots can help businesses interact with
their customers and prospects in a new way using messaging apps, the latest
technology, and Artificial Intelligence. </p>



<h2>What is a Chatbot?</h2>



<p>A chatbot is a service that can interact with you just like a real person. Powered by rules and  Artificial Intelligence, chatbots are programmed to simulate a real conversation with users through a chat interface. They are based on machine learning to imitate human conversation and react to service requests.</p>



<p>AI helps them learn the language, human tone, and behavior with every interaction, which in turn helps them to be more intelligent and serve the users better. </p>



<p>For a better understanding of how chatbots can contribute to
your business, let us find the top 7 benefits of chatbots:</p>



<h2>1. Being Present on Messaging Platforms</h2>



<p>Today messaging applications have more users than social
media network. And as customers today think that chat is a convenient and
faster way to interact with a business, businesses today have the chance to
reach more audience via chatbots while staying trendy.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The Majority of smartphone users today do not want to
download new apps. So, businesses can integrate their chatbot in one of the
popular platforms that the customers use on a daily basis such as &#8211; Facebook,
Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. It will also save you time and money. </p>



<h2>2. Improved Customer Service</h2>



<h4>A. Extensive Customer Assistance</h4>



<p>According to a <a href="https://econsultancy.com/83-of-online-shoppers-need-support-to-complete-a-purchase-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">survey</a>, 83% of online shoppers want assistance during shopping. So, your customers may need assistance at any time. Additionally, shoppers may also face navigation issues, or have queries about registration, payment, checkout, and delivery or about the product itself.</p>



<p>In such situations, chatbots can provide real-time assistance through interactive communication over text and voice. They can also provide customers with important relevant information from knowledge base, blogs, tutorial videos and so on.</p>



<h4>B. Always-Available Customer Support</h4>



<p>A great 24/7 customer service has a positive impact on customer satisfaction. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">Chatbots can help you improve the customer support</a> process by quickly giving automated answers to repetitive questions immediately and forwarding the complex ones to a human agent.</p>



<p>Apart from that, chatbots allow businesses to attend more queries at the same time, allowing companies to scale up their operation to new markets globally.</p>



<h4>C. Proactive Customer Interaction</h4>



<p>Companies can also use chatbots to start <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/proactive-customer-service-and-how-to-start-practicing-it.html">proactive customer interactions</a> regarding any issue, any time of the day. This will make your customers feel that your brand cares for them on a 24/7 basis. This can help improve your brand perception in the long run.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chatbot-example.jpg" alt="AI-Based Chatbot Example" class="wp-image-6579" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chatbot-example.jpg 720w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chatbot-example-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<h2>3. Increased Customer Engagement</h2>



<p>Chatbots can be a great tool for customer engagement.
Chatbots can provide the customers with a specific slice of information and
lead the interaction based on the user input at that time.&nbsp; This way, chatbots never provides a dull
interaction with irrelevant and useless information resulting in better
engagement. </p>



<h2>4. Monitoring Consumer Data and Gaining Insights</h2>



<p>Businesses can make changes in their service/products based on the feedback chatbots collect through simple questions. As chatbots are also capable of tracking purchasing patterns and consumer behavior by monitoring user data, they can also help a company to decide marketing strategies.</p>



<p>Companies can use chatbots to track consumer request and responses, predict responses based on the language and direct the chatbot to suggest an alternative product or service. </p>



<h2>5. Cost Savings</h2>



<p>Implementing a full functioning chatbot is cheaper and faster than creating a cross-platform app or hiring chat support agents for each task. Businesses today can <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="choose from ready-made applications (opens in a new tab)">choose from ready-made applications</a> developed by Facebook, Microsoft, and other IT giants.</p>



<p>Being automated solutions, chatbots can handle many customers at once, saving employee costs and eliminating the scope for human errors. Finally, as customers can access chatbots easily within seconds and interact immediately, the cost of user acquisition also comes down.</p>



<p>These are some of the major benefits chatbots bring to your business. with technological advancements, chatbots will become smarter, better and more effective. As chatbot gradually gain maturity, this is the right time to adopt this new technology and give your business an edge.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While customer survey is a useful way to gather a large volume of data in a very short span of time, creating a useful customer survey is not an easy task. Companies must be careful while creating a customer survey. You can also ask for the help of your <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/call-center.html">call center service provider</a> in creating the perfect survey.&nbsp; Having experience in conducting numerous surveys, call center service providers possess a deep understanding of what a successful customer survey should look like and can help you with not only creating such surveys but also see it become successful. </p>



<p>When it comes to creating the perfect customer survey,
Fusion has a set of ten rules.&nbsp; Using
these 10 easy tips it has helped a number of businesses achieve their desired
results.&nbsp; What to know about them? Read
on: &#8211; </p>



<h3>1. Keep it Short</h3>



<p>A short survey is often a successful one.&nbsp; Your survey should be clear and concise. You
must find the shortest way to ask questions that get you the total answer.&nbsp; Eliminate superfluous phrasing, reduce the
character count and try everything you can to keep it short. A short survey
often has the lowest abandon rate. After all, no one wants to answer a
questionnaire for 30 minutes and more.</p>



<h3>2. Ask questions with a purpose only</h3>



<p>Don’t hesitate about cutting unnecessary questions from your
surveys. Every question in your survey must have a clear purpose and a good
reason to be there.&nbsp; If not, chuck it
out. If you can monitor the channel through which the customer came to your
site, do not hesitate to cut it out of the survey. These questions make the
survey lengthy and make customers abandon the survey. </p>



<h3>3. Create open-ended questions</h3>



<p>Sure, multiple choice questions look tempting, but to get
insightful feedback open-ended questions are your best bet. It will allow you
to know what your customers are really thinking. But do not ask questions that
may come with a big, lengthy answer. It’s best to take on brief questions first
to create a sense of progress, and then give your customers the opportunity to
elaborate on their thoughts.</p>



<p>Fusion plans a question with a simple introduction, and then follow up the answer with an open-ended question such as, “<em>Why is that so?</em>”</p>



<h3>4. One question at a time</h3>



<p>Bombarding your customer with so many questions at once is
never a good idea and yet we see it in many such surveys. It feels like being
interrogated by someone who won’t want to listen to you. For quality responses,
your customers need time to think and you have to give them that.&nbsp; If you keep asking multiple questions at one
go, you will get half-hearted answers because at that point your customer is
just looking for a way to get to the end. </p>



<h3>5. Make scales consistent</h3>



<p>We often come across surveys that have very confusing usage
of common scales under a different context.&nbsp;
</p>



<p>For example – initially, you are to rate an experience between 1-5, with 1 being “Poor” and 5 being &#8220;excellent&#8221;. Later in the survey, you are to evaluate the importance of certain things, in which 1 means the most important and 5 means less so. </p>



<p>&nbsp;This is utterly
confusing to a customer.&nbsp; A customer may
completely miss the change and give an inaccurate answer to the same.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/survey.jpg" alt="Customer Survey" class="wp-image-6449" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/survey.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/survey-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<h3>6. Avoid loaded questions</h3>



<p>Do not ask questions with a bias in their phrasing that may
lead respondents towards a particular answer.&nbsp;
It will not get you the result you are looking for. Clip the language
that can influence a respondent’s thinking into answering in a certain way. </p>



<p>For example – “<em>What do you think of our award-winning popular children book series?</em>” is not the way to ask questions in surveys. You would get a far honest answer if you ask “<em>what do you think about our children book series?</em>”</p>



<p>While the first question in the example will earn you
supporters who tell you what you want to hear, the second question will get you
closer to the real scenario. So, in case you want to get a real picture, stir
clear of those adjectives and specialties unless absolutely necessary.</p>



<h3>7. Use Yes/No questions</h3>



<p>If a question can be answered in yes/no, try to frame the
question that way. These close-ended questions make great starter questions for
a survey as they are easier to evaluate and complete. </p>



<h3>8. Avoid assumptions</h3>



<p>If you create questions assuming that all the customers are
knowledgeable about something, you will have problems. Keep a check on your
language and terminology and stir clear of industry jargons, references, and
acronyms. </p>



<p>Rather you can ask customers about their opinion on one
subject and ask them to be specific. It will get you a far better response.</p>



<h3>9. Timing matters</h3>



<p>Time is crucial in a customer survey. In most cases,
companies conduct customer surveys once per quarter.&nbsp; But waiting that long to know the pulse of
the customer does not seem enough. You need to conduct small but potent surveys
at regular intervals to get the real picture. Alternatively, you can gather the
idea by looking at customer satisfaction rating and other metrics. </p>



<h3>10. Entice them with bonus</h3>



<p>Enticing the customers with an incentive can increase the
participation rate. It can be a discount, account credit or a giveaway. One may
think that incentive may influence the quality of responses, but it is likely
not to be the case. Also, see whether you can financially handle the incentive
and then proceed. </p>



<p>These are the ten tips that Fusion follows for improving
customer surveys on behalf of its clients. Numerous of our clients benefitted
from our deep insight into customer survey domain.</p>

		<title>6 Ways To Provide The Elderly Customers With Quality Customer Experience</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While we read a lot about how to provide <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/provide-quality-customer-service-to-the-millennials.html">quality
customer experience to the millennials</a> through business interactions,
little has been said about improving customer experience of the elderly. When
you have an elderly customer at the other end of the line, you should treat
them very differently from the way you deal with your millennial customers. </p>



<p>Dealing with an elderly customer comes with its own unique
challenges. You cannot deal with them the way you can deal with millennials and
middle-aged.&nbsp; The reasons behind this
are-</p>



<ul><li>Most of them are not that tech-savvy</li><li>Health deterioration has led to hearing loss and
memory loss among the elderly</li><li>They have a hard time remembering things and
therefore keeps repeating themselves.</li><li>They communicate slower</li><li>They do not like being patronized</li></ul>



<p>Elderly people often find it hard to understand the basics
of modern technology like fixing the simplest computer issue or resolving a
billing problem. Therefore, a customer service agent needs to give extra
attention while attending their calls.</p>



<p>Here are some suggestions for making the interaction go smoothly.</p>



<h3>1. Treat Them with Respect</h3>



<p>Seniors often feel like they are being patronized or belittled by young agents even when it is not so.&nbsp; Therefore, an agent needs to be extra cautious about while talking to them. Instead of talking down to elderly customers, the agent must recognize their wisdom and treat them with respect.</p>



<p>If it’s taking longer to reach a solution due to their slower communication, an agent must not let frustration show. Working with them in a non-condescending tone often achieves much better results.</p>



<h3>2. Write It Down</h3>



<p>Deafness and forgetfulness are often the most common
elements that comes with age and they make getting the message across a
challenge.&nbsp; Therefore, writing down the
information on a notepad or email can make the whole process a lot easier and
help them in a better way.</p>



<h3>3. Give Coupons</h3>



<p>Recognizing the economic standing of the senior customers is
the first step of forging a lasting relationship with your senior customers. Living
off their retirement funds, seniors can benefit from special discounts and
coupons. If you can provide them with special discounts whenever possible, it
will create a good relationship between you and your elderly customers who will
get a strong sense of customer experience. </p>



<h3>4. Patience is Virtue</h3>



<p>Seniors often take longer to make a decision, understand a
request, and respond. But that is no excuse for agents to show their annoyance
or frustration. On the contrary, patience is the key here. Agents need to
slowdown, listen, and gather all information. And once they do that, dealing
with senior customers gets a lot easier.</p>



<h3>5. Maintain a Cheerful and Helpful Attitude</h3>



<p>While the millennials prefer self-help tools, senior
customers are still mostly old-school – they prefer talking to a live agent,
either face-to-face or over the phone. Therefore, agents taking the calls
should maintain a cheerful and helpful attitude to give the senior customers a
good customer service experience.</p>



<h3>6. Lend an Ear</h3>



<p>Many of the elderly customers are lonely and do not even have someone to talk to.&nbsp; Therefore, they ted to talk more even while discussing business with a live human agent. Sharing stories or talking excessively makes them feel better and listening to them goes a long way to create a pleasant experience for them. So, do not cut them off while they are sharing their stories. It will help you resolve the problem and provide them with outstanding customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>While it is not guaranteed that all the elderly customers will have a great customer experience even when you follow the tips mentioned above, but these tips will definitely help you improve their experience and earn their loyalty.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The hospitality industry has performed very well in the past
few years and it is expected to have robust growth in this financial period as
well.&nbsp; Thanks to increasing income levels
in emerging markets and the current global economy, the hospitality industry
has come across a sea of opportunities. As corporate travels, adventure
holidays, and leisure trips increases, the hospitality industry must also gear
up to meet the ever-increasing expectations of their customers. </p>



<p>To present the customers with a wonderful experience, the
hospitality industry must put more emphasis on customer service. As customers
today are exposed to the gold standard of customer service, they can no longer
be sated with good food and a comfortable bed. They want much more – they expect
a hospitality business to provide them with a seamless experience in everything
from interactions to services. </p>



<p>For this reason, more and more hospitality businesses are
trying hard to provide excellent customer service to make their customers happy
about their overall experience. That is not, however, an easy task to do,
especially in the wake of the ever-changing demands of customers today. In
fact, it can turn into a time-consuming, costly affair that can shift the
business’s focus from its core operations and ruin the entire experience for a
customer.&nbsp; </p>
