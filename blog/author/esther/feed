<p>Gamification is a fun and growing way that can improve collection call center performance and agent engagement. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">Gamification</a> has been very effective in improving employee performance and business results at collections-focused contact centers. Benefits of gamification programs include increased revenues from higher recovery rates, improved compliance, making training more fun and effective, and improved employee retention.</p>



<p>Employee engagement is a persistent problem of
collection-based call centers. Due to unengaged employees, collection call
centers often face an issue like: </p>



<ul><li>Flat or declining recovery rates</li><li>High abandon rates</li><li>Increased customer service complaints</li><li>Increased compliance violations</li><li>High employee attrition rates</li></ul>



<p>However, by adding gamification to the mix, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/collection-services.html">collection call centers</a> can improve script adherence, raising recovery rates, improving compliance with disclosure requirements, and reducing the onboard time for new agents by making training more effective. This change in agent behavior also helps collection centers to improve customer satisfaction ratings.</p>



<p>Having a long experience in the collection industry, Fusion
has a step-by-step approach in designing a gamification strategy to engage its
collection agents.&nbsp; </p>



<ol><li>Define goals</li><li>Apply interaction analytics to identify baseline
performance and improvement opportunities</li><li>Define key performance indicators (KPIs) for the
program</li><li>Identify the appropriate motivators for agents</li></ol>



<p>With our experience in this field, we understand that
successful gamification is not game oriented but goal oriented. Rooted in clear
business goals quantifiable by appropriate metrics, successful gamification
needs to have the right motivators so that agents can easily get hooked. Some
important things to remember while designing a gamification program:</p>



<h3>1. Define Goals</h3>



<p>A gamification program without a defined business goal is
doomed to fail from the beginning. If you don’t know what you want to achieve
through the program, running the program has no point at all. Whether you want
to improve customer satisfaction by 5%, reduce 10% employee attrition, or
improve your recovery rates, you need to be clear about that even before
designing a gamification program.</p>



<h3>2. Define KPI</h3>



<p>Having the right metrics is the key. You cannot judge
customer satisfaction by looking at script adherence rate. To make a
gamification program successful, you need appropriate metrics that help you
measure your success in terms of your business goals. You can use analytics to
keep a track of how things are going and whether there is any scope for
improvement.</p>



<h3>3. Choose Motivators</h3>



<p>Choosing motivators can be a difficult task as not everyone
is motivated by the same thing. While baby boomers get motivated to earn points
and rewards, millennials get motivated by public recognition. Therefore, it can
be easily said that there is no one size fits all reward.&nbsp; While money can be a powerful reward, it is
not the only effective incentive. Incentives like paid time off, meals,
merchandise, company gear, recognition on the company’s social media page are a
few other incentives that work well.</p>



<h3>4. Set Time Limits</h3>



<p>A contest that goes on indefinitely will lose its effectiveness. Setting a certain start and end time helps businesses raise participation and effort while the contest is in effect. If a long-term program is needed to meet the business goal (<em>for example improving a 5 percent improvement in customer satisfaction ratings every year</em>), consider conducting a series of consecutive contests rather than one long one. </p>



<p>It is important to recognize the end of the program where
top performers will be recognized and participants will be updated about the result
and how the program helped meeting the business goal. You can also conclude the
program with a small party to get the feedback that can help you make future
engagements more effective. </p>



<h3>5. Inspire Continued Involvement</h3>



<p>Contests should have the mechanisms to motivate participants
to stay involved, even after meeting the performance required or when they have
almost zero chance of winning. You can encourage agents to continue working
towards goals as groups. That way, they will be able to achieve more than they
can achieve individually.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Fusion has seen that providing rewards for meeting
performance thresholds is a great way to promote continued involvement and keep
participants motivated. Reward thresholds can also be used in combination with
more competitive contests to get more effective results.</p>



<h3>6. Communicate</h3>



<p>To maximize the effectiveness of a gamification program you need consistent communication before, during, and after the contest. This will help organizations maximize agent participation in a program, improve buy-in by helping agents understand why a certain goal or metric is vital, explain rules clearly so that there is no confusion or hard feelings about unclear rules, and make motivation more effective by bringing good performers into the limelight. Fusion has always found communication to be the key to successful gamification programs in a collection call center. </p>



<p>These are some of the ways a collection call center can improve its employee engagement and customer experience through the call center. The key is to find a defined goal, time limit, performance indicators, and the right motivator, and measuring it all through application analytics. If you rightly engage your employees through gamification, your employees will be inspired to perform at optimum level even after the program ended, resulting in better customer experience as well. </p>

<p>A lack of customer complaint is not always the best news for
a business.&nbsp; In fact, customer complaint
is good for business.&nbsp; It provides
businesses with an insight about what they need to improve or change to keep
the customers happy.</p>



<p>So, even if you get vitriol from the customer, please note
that it may contain valuable customer feedback underneath it. It is important
to remember that every negative experience can be salvaged and transformed into
an opportunity. All you need to do is to carefully asses and address every
customer complaint.</p>



<p>As per data nine out of ten times, a customer will continue
doing business with you even after a slip-up—but only if you wholly fix the
situation the first time. And therein lies the merits of dealing with the
angriest of your customers. Fusion has some nuggets of wisdom to share in this
regard that we have acquired over more than 15 years:</p>



<h3>1. Look past the rage</h3>



<p>just because your customer is spewing vitriol does not mean there
is no merit in his argument. Every argument, including the angry ones, has some
insight. It is the job of the business to listen to each of its customers and
act upon their feedback.</p>



<h3>2. Record useful complaint</h3>



<p>While helping customers is important, meeting their every
demand without a second thought is wrong.&nbsp;
It encourages some customers to demand free stuff.</p>



<p>For this reason, you need to record every customer complaint
in an organized way. Evaluate each complaint and categorize them. The key is to
make it easy, and browse-able. Give your team clear instructions to make note
of every useful complaint, and you can rest easy because you will hear about
them.</p>



<h3>3. Identify the type of customer you are communicating with</h3>



<p>You should use different tactics to deal with different
customers. And for that you need to understand the customer types. Here are the
most prominent types you will be communicating with:</p>



<ul><li><strong><em>Meek customers</em></strong> – they need probing
from your end</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Aggressive customers </em></strong>– they need to
be dealt with firm politeness</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>High roller customer</em></strong> – they pay well
and demand premium support for it. They need to be on a VIP list.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Chronic complainer</em></strong> – these customers
should be dealt with patience.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Never-happy customer</em></strong> – they need to
be dealt with as firmly as possible</li></ul>



<h3>4. Don&#8217;t be passive aggressive</h3>



<p>Say you are sorry and mean it.&nbsp; Never misuse the tone and sound dismissive
while apologizing to the customers. They will appreciate your apology.</p>



<h3>5. Transfer calls only after some explanation</h3>



<p>no one likes their calls to get transferred. Therefore, if you have to do it, kindly provide the customer with an explanation. this will help you earn their trust.</p>



<p>Follow these simple rules while talking to the angriest customer. </p>
