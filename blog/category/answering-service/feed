								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Owning a small business is tough. You have to juggle a lot of tasks, including answering calls. That’s one task that can claim a huge chunk of your precious time.</p>
<p>Don’t get us wrong.  We know that interacting with the buyer is one of the most crucial things to build your business. But spending too much time on answering the customer queries can shift your focus from the other important tasks, such as &#8211; marketing, and stocktaking.</p>
<p>The point is, it simply isn&#8217;t logical to spend much time on the phone when you have a business to manage.  Then again, if your customers and prospects reach your voicemail upon calling, they will be frustrated. That would lose you a lot of business. What to do?</p>
<p>Sure, you can hire a full-time employee to attend the calls. But that might just be a waste of money. What you can do instead, is hire an answering service. A virtual receptionist will ensure that your customers are received warmly every single time.  The service will maintain the highest level of efficiency, professionalism, and a personal touch.</p>
<p>A good live answering service helps a business solve a number of challenges, including:</p>
<h3>Providing customer support 24/7/365</h3>
<p>No matter how dedicated you are to your customers and business, you cannot always be there to answer the phone. Installing an answering machine or voicemail isn’t much help either; since most people are refusing to leave a message at the beep. On the other hand, an answering service available 24/7/365 at your aid means that there is a friendly agent to greet your callers, make them feel more comfortable to leave messages or ask questions, and get them what they need, pronto.</p>
<h3>Handling common issues without getting involved</h3>
<p>You can save your precious time and money by providing your answering service with specific instructions to handle common calls. Thus, when a caller inquires about your business hours or returns policy, the agent can provide them with that information right away.  There is no need for you to get involved.  They can even offer scripted guidance to aid a customer.  For example – while setting up an appointment with the doctor, an answering service hired by a doctor can remind people to bring previous prescriptions and other documents to the appointment.</p>
<h3>Re-routing calls to a designated emergency number</h3>
<p>You get your fair share of after-hour phone calls in the emergency number, and we know how much it stresses you out to handle them.  On the other hand, if you entrust the task to an answering service, they will make sure that each of the calls gets answered, each message gets noted, and you are not contacted unless there’s a real emergency. This way, your off time remains yours.</p>
<h3>Getting an organized list for call-backs</h3>
<p>Why waste time making a list of callers from your voicemail, when you can route calls through your answering service partner? You will receive a tidy log of callers, complete with their needs and phone numbers. You can quickly check the list off as you contact the callers. Being organized gives you the chance to become incredibly responsive to customer needs. You’ll return calls more quickly, and not forget a single message.</p>
<p>There are many challenges that hiring an answering service can solve quickly and affordably, irrespective of the size or type of your business. At Fusion, we are trained to keep your clients’ information confidential and secure while providing your business with a warm, friendly voice.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the present age, stellar <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html" target="_blank">customer service</a> can become the sole differentiator between a successful and a failed business. Every business has the intent to provide state of the art services to their customers.  But here’s the fact, providing round the clock customer service is a tough call for a business. After all, most businesses do not run 24/7.</p>
<p>That is where answering services and live chat services come into the picture. A business can entrust a third-party provider with this services and be sure that their customers will be attended to. Every. Single. Time.</p>
<p>But when deciding on which of these two services is best for the customers, a company will have to evaluate their pros and cons into consideration before opting for one that is right for their business.</p>
<h2><strong>Telephone Answering Service</strong></h2>
<p>Telephone answering services provide ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is always someone there to take a customer`s phone call, day or night.</li>
<li>It alleviates customer dissatisfaction even when they do not get to talk to an agent right away.</li>
<li>It allows businesses to filter out some of the unnecessary spam calls</li>
<li>Customers get to talk to a live person. This immediately makes them comfortable.</li>
<li>It can help increase customer satisfaction</li>
<li>It also offer a professional impression</li>
</ul>
<p>While an answering service can certainly help improve customer service by offering the customers an outlet round the clock, it may not be the right solution for every office. Even when one want an answering service outsourcing, they may have a tough time deciding, how many hours do they want to stay open or what type of answering service do they require.  Fret not; here is a great <a href="http://www.business2community.com/customer-experience/telephone-answering-service-decision-chart-0172062#!B1Ai8" target="_blank">answering service decision making chart</a> to make things easier.</p>
<p>An answering service is probably best for taking non-emergency phone calls and channeling them to the right people. This will ensure a prompt hassle-free service that will make both the customers and the business happy.</p>
<h2><strong>Live Chat Service</strong></h2>
<p>In the present age almost every customer has access to internet via desktop or smartphone.  Therefore, live chat has come up as a viable alternative to answering service.  In fact, live chat can prove to be crucial to the future customer service scenario. Adding live chat to the business website can give it a serious edge.  :</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows customers to communicate with a business directly from the company website.</li>
<li>Live chat can cut down the cost of running customer service 24/7</li>
<li>It simplifies the queries in a question and answer format and makes the whole process much more convenient.</li>
<li>It allows customers a way to get answers without contacting the customer service.</li>
<li>It increases sales according to a recent research by <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/live-chat/" target="_blank">Forrester</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite its obvious facilities, not every business has a favorable opinion about them.  According to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is less personal than talking to an agent and that may affect the satisfaction level of a customer.</li>
<li>Customers who prefer more attention may find live chat impassive.</li>
<li>Since it is hard to decipher the tone and intent in live chat, the customers may have different understanding about how they are served.</li>
<li>24/7 chat service can be expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Should a Business Choose?</strong></h2>
<p>Both live chat and telephone answering services have their high points and can prove to be excellent customer service tools. Both of them allow businesses to connect their customers with a live agent round the clock. So, it can be hard decision to choose between the two. A business may opt for any one of these services depending on the nature of their operations and can still make their customers happy.</p>
<p>However, in the ideal case scenario, a balance between the two services can be the most effective customer service weapon a company can have.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever you have some medical requirements and you call up the hospital or medical practitioners at the wee hours, who picks up your phone? The office is not open at the late hours, then who interacts with you?</p>
<p>Are you wondering? Nothing to wonder, it is the answering service, that the medical practitioners have enabled to help people in the late hours.</p>
<p>The survey done by <a href="http://jfponline.com/pdf%2F5203%2F5203JFP_OriginalResearch1.pdf" target="_blank">The Journal of Family Practice</a> shows, that the doctor responds to 67% of the answering service messages almost immediately and they prove effective for both doctors and patients.</p>
<p>It does not matter whatever time it may be, you can always reach your doctor. Fusion BPO has modified their answering service and has taken it to the next level to offer medical answering service on behalf of their clients from healthcare industry.</p>
<p>Take for example, if you are sick  and need doctors’ advise, then I think answering service is the way out for your practitioners. As office of the doctor remains closed at late hours, the answering service is going to provide prompt service to patients.</p>
<p>Well, we here at Fusion blog is going to explain you on the working of answering services.</p>
<p><strong><i>What happens when a customer calls at the doctor&#8217;s office who has enabled answering service?</i></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It is late night you need a little doctor’s advise as your son is sick. You called up knowing about closed office.</li>
<li>You end up speaking to someone and they page the doctor for you, isn’t it awesome!</li>
<li>Who answered? Are those open lines of communication?</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you know with whom you spoke? – You spoke with an answering service. Do you want to know to whom the phone carrier sends the call to the doctor’s office?</p>
<p>As the doctor’s office is closed, the phones transfer the call to the answering service via call forwarding. The phone company sends out the voice call to the answering service department along with a 10 digit ANI (like caller ID).</p>
<p>At Fusion, our answering service department, and the PBX identify the call. PBX follows a dial plan and sends the voice and data of the particular call to an answering service operator like us.</p>
<p>We have our agent at the right end of the phone who is ready to greet in a courteous manner. Then you speak with our agents relaying your message and the urgency. Our agents are there to listen to your problem that is against doctor’s protocol.</p>
<p>The Fusion answering service department follows a protocol to reach the doctor. Our answering service thus relays the message to the physician on call by patching through their phone. You then get to speak to your respective doctor, and he responds to the call to render great advice.</p>
<p><b><i>What We Need To Maintain In The Answering Service? </i></b></p>
<p>Fusion being the leading contact center provides effective answering service across the global destination maintains the 5 pillars of growths.</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety</li>
<li>Efficiency for patients</li>
<li>Effective message service for both patients and doctors</li>
<li>Timely responses</li>
<li>Patient centered services</li>
</ul>
<p>Get through all your medical requirements with Fusion’s steadfast answering service.</p>
