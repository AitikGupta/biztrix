								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With how many businesses do your customers interact before communicating with your business? In most cases, it is not less than 5 to 10 in a business day.</p>
<p>What makes them talk to other business on the way? Experts say that customers are in search of refined services. They are tired of those odds customer practices such as waiting long hours in the call queue, placing a wrong order, a poor mail delivery or receiving someone else’s mail. This all goofs make the customers feel distracted.</p>
<p>There are chances for a consumer to get exposure to a much better experience than the experience provided by your organization. This positive experience may stop the customer from doing business with you. Often, this bitter business mishap strikes your brain with some common questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is lacking in your customer service?</li>
<li>What is it that your customers are looking for?</li>
<li>What is so special in your competitor’s customer service strategy?</li>
</ul>
<p>All the questions stated have only one answer &#8211; <b><i>‘Personalized Services.&#8217;</i></b></p>
<h3>Define Personalized Services</h3>
<p>Personalization is more than paying lip service to customer’s preference. Rather, it is about adding value to customer’s choice. Respecting customer’s choices and opinions can often result in good business. In other words, customer empowerment is the number one rule of offering a personalized service.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, your business needs to ride the glory and cater customer needs accordingly. That is the reason B2B and B2C marketers prefer to outsource their customer service management to contact centers.</p>
<p>Rendering personalized services is most important within a contact center – a touch-point that is continually under focus when it comes to customer experience. State-of-the-art BPOs treats the customer with the right amount of attention so that they keep coming back.</p>
<h3>A Bad Experience Says It All</h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.soundresultsonhold.com/on_hold_stats_studies.html" target="_blank">Sound Results on Hold</a>, 8 to 15 percent of the customer base of a company is lost every year. And 68 percent is lost due to indifferent and negative phone treatment. In this context, you will like your contact centers to treat customers with personalized attention that befit them in any situation.</p>
<p>Customers often love to talk about a bad experience while they rarely converse about a good customer experience. How can bad experiences spread so fast?</p>
<p>Word-of-mouth is the possible situation that foretells about bad interactions faster than you can imagine. Communications vehicles like mobiles and social media accelerated the reach of word-of-mouth. Therefore, contact centers prefer to blend self-service with assisted service to drive better customer service experience.</p>
<h3>Personalized Services @Fusion</h3>
<p>At Fusion, we are trying to find the best possible ways to amplify customer experience. We rely on personalized interactions as a potential platform. We provide impeccable service to B2B/ B2C clients to lessen down their fear of losing customer base every year.</p>
<p>Here, we are going to share some benefits that our clients have experienced with our personalized customer services. Find out how we provide personalized services to customers irrespective of the business type:</p>
<ol>
<li><i></i>We look at the potential value. <i></i></li>
<li>We always get in touch with past contacts.</li>
<li>We are technologically atheist.</li>
<li>We ask for an apology.</li>
<li>We ask improvement suggestions from customers.</li>
<li>We prefer to invest in our staff.</li>
<li>We identify the customers need.</li>
<li>We use personalized greetings – knowing your customers by name, is still effective.</li>
<li>We use IVR.</li>
<li>We mix customer experience with employee experience.</li>
<li>We did away with those traditional scripts.</li>
<li>We focus on improvement of customer service at every interval.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fusion follows 5Ds to ensure unparallel customer service management:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Defining the vision of customer experience </i></li>
<li><i>Discovering relevant channels</i></li>
<li><i>Detecting the place where our customer wants to be heard</i></li>
<li><i>Digging out relevant replies in context</i></li>
<li><i>Devising new answers to benefit each and every parts of customer base</i></li>
</ul>
<p>In vogue contact centers employ routing structure and applications to track down customer activity across multiple channels. At Fusion, we tighten it further by integrating self-service and back-office applications. This helps us to stay with a customer 24/7/365 even if the person shifts randomly from <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/3-aspects-of-customer-management-strategize-for-live-chat-channels.html">Live Chat</a> to phone or from email to mobile or social media.</p>
<p>After personalizing contact center services at Fusion, we are able to narrow down worries of B2B clients and negative impression of their customers. As we work to reel in consumers to our client’s company, personalization is the only bait we use to make customers keep coming back to business.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often mitigated by firm limitations, asset managers used to avoid outsourcing that their counterparts in the credit card and mortgage industry preferred to use.</p>
<p>With the change in the operational and global financial structures, offshoring has become a necessity for the investors. It is now used as a strategic tool by their asset managers to cut down costs, bring change in the service levels and support differentiated offerings.</p>
<h3>What Has Made The Asset Managers To Adapt Offshore Outsourcing?</h3>
<p>Asset managers are conservative and risk averse class. However, what made them changed their mindset and embrace outsourcing as part of their business model? Well, there are three basic reasons, which say why they had a mind shift:</p>
<p><strong>Change in Global Business Model</strong></p>
<p>Asset managers have realized that, in an ever changing global business model, traditional ways are not going to work out. With rapid globalization, customers now demands international assets and want to invest in global capital markets. In the last five years, global and emerging market funds have aggregated to USD 400 billion, says Oliver Wyman in a <a href="http://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/global/en/2014/mar/Wholesale_Investment_Banking_2014.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>. This astonishing figure is making asset managers fall for business process outsourcing.</p>
<p><strong>Change in Demands</strong></p>
<p>Well, today’s complex market movement is seen as multiple arrays of asset classes and products available to the institutional and retail investors. With the rise in demand and information, change in customer behavioral pattern is compelling the asset managers to outsource their business.</p>
<p><strong>Cost Reduction</strong></p>
<p>Asset managers tend to transform price and value equation, target right customers with advisory services, and provide enhanced customer support but all within a fixed budget. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_11/b4219041484091.htm" target="_blank">RIA</a>s (<em>Registered Investment Advisors</em>) want to focus on operating costs as business is turning complex, thus finding out a partner who can leverage cost-effective solution has become significant. Hence, asset managers’ choose next generation offshoring as a strategic solution.</p>
<h3>How State-of-the-Art BPOs Can Help Investment Managers?</h3>
<p>Well, Fusion had a face-to-face conversation with some asset managers, who have shown interest in outsourcing their business processes. However, most of them want an instant solution to higher transaction costs and daily paperwork. They now look for partners who can mitigate risks and strike a balance between cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Well, most of the state-of-the-art BPOs like Fusion are reliable and provides industry specific solutions to investment management space, so choosing us as a partner will reduce risk and threats that asset managers often fear.</p>
<p>How Next Generation Offshoring Can Provide Industry Specific Solutions?</p>
<ul>
<li>With the offshoring, the asset management community will adhere to a number of opportunities that can tailor traditional business model, yet build new capabilities for the marketplace.</li>
<li>Offshore providers of today can take on ownership of the transactional back and middle office activities with reduced risk and can embolden back office activities related to account set-up, data conversion and work maintenance.</li>
<li>Offshore delivery models are going to provide adequate scope that can have high impacts on the operating margins.</li>
<li>Offshoring is going to entail additional value beyond cost arbitrage increasing front-to-back agility.</li>
<li>Right provider can help asset managers build and support sophisticated asset allocation models, enhancing investors’ decision-making ability.</li>
<li>Moreover, the provider can provide investment managers with deep knowledge on underlying processes and metric, develop a variable unit pricing model and will allow more flexibility than traditional FTE pricing structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, question might arise among the strategist and market critics – <i>“Whether or not a next-gen offshore provider can improve value-equation for the asset management industry?”</i></p>
<p>A huge gap underlies between extent of domain knowledge and track records delivering end-to-end processes that providers must overcome to serve the investment management space. This business is relatively complex compared to credit card and mortgage industry.</p>
<p>Asset or wealth management sectors in offshore locations like Philippines and India has a substantial rise down the last few years. India is handling large captive operations which continue to generate consistent results. Thus, a number of retail brokerage firms and asset managers have started to leverage outsourcing benefits from simple account set up and compliance reporting to more complex licensed transactions and portfolio advisory services.</p>
<h3>What Will Compel Asset Managers To Choose Outsourcing As A Strategic Tool?</h3>
<p>The next-gen outsourcing is going to provide a host of benefits to the asset managers such as ability to customize, flexibility in prices that can meet peak and trough of the market and can gain deep insight on the end-to-end processes. Offshoring industry will lift their abilities to provide service in a consistent and transparent manner, to gain confidence of this risk-averse class. At the same time, asset managers must evaluate outsourcing in a more strategic way.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s Move With the Trend</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to rethink and evaluate traditional back-office outsourcing. Now investment industry can get a more comprehensive mix of offshoring with a front office, middle office and back office. Moreover, wealth/asset management industry must focus on right shoring partners as they can serve with onsite and offshore services to meet end-to-end customer needs.</p>
<p>With next-gen offshoring, investment management space can enjoy a larger value play. As it will let them gain competitive advantage and lever improved customer experience 24X7 through multiple channels.</p>
<p>Fusion holds a simple thought on this mindset change of asset managers and their choice of leveraging business to offshoring people. We say:</p>
<p><i>“Global BPOs are just a catalyst to an asset manager, providing similar services just like we provide others. We invest in delivery models that can meet all complex needs of the concerned industry conveniently. Rather we are ready to serve anyone who looks up for highly valuable opportunity.”</i><i></i></p>
<p>So, join the revolution with the next-generation outsourcing today!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the economy picking up, the outsourcing market is budding in volumes of contractual activities. Previous years created an enervated environment, so marketers this year reinstate their faith in US Budget 2014, claiming that the enterprise will claw back control on the conservative market.</p>
<p>Due to macro-economic challenges companies had to adopt conservative spending approach, besides there was a retard in the manufacturing and the financial services in the US. However, in the last two quarters thawing approach was strongly prevalent, which some experts tagged as <a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-12-17/news/45296187_1_vineet-nayyar-telecom-growth-rate" target="_blank">demand revival</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the BPO industry across the globe set high expectations in 2014 as US is the largest market and fetches the industry the most business.</p>
<p>So let us take a quick look at the US budget and its impact on the Indian as well as global outsourcing landscape.</p>
<h3>Data/Numbers That Are Going To Cheer Up BPO Sector</h3>
<p>According to John Keppel of <a href="http://www.isg-one.com/web/research-insights/isg-outsourcing-index/" target="_blank">ISG</a>, commercial outsourcing contracts with annual contract value (ACV) $5 million or more, jumped 13% in the fourth quarter of 2013, whereas the dropped total ACV 12%.</p>
<p>It makes clear that a shift from short-term anomaly to higher deal volumes and lower contract value will brings change in the outsourcing business.</p>
<p>We are going to share some numbers that are surely going to cheer the Indian outsourcing arena.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to <a href="https://research.everestgrp.com/Product/25Feb14-Webinar/Webinar-Deck-Global-Services-Development-inQ4-2013-and-2013-Year" target="_blank">Everest</a> Group, offshore outsourcing will go up in the coming year by 10% to 12% compared to 6% in the past year.</li>
<li>Moreover, according to <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24432813" target="_blank">IDC</a>, US have shown 5% increase in the overall use of technology, which will help to shape positive business decisions.</li>
<li>Short-term considerations are going to keep their investments moderate, but we anticipate that the IT spends will continue to align by 13% and above.</li>
<li>Even brokerage also expects that <a href="http://www.nasscom.in/sites/default/files/NASSCOM%20Annual%20Report%202013-14.pdf" target="_blank">NASSCOM</a> will raise their sector forecast to 15% and above in the next FY compared to 12-14% that will stay until March 2014.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Outsourcing Scenario in 2014</h3>
<p>Business Process Outsourcing has taken the center stage due to the rise in powerful arbitrage-led value proposition. After undergoing metamorphoses and due to high competitive intensity, state-of-the-art providers like Fusion and other big names in the BPO industry will look for more innovative and differentiated solutions.</p>
<p>This demand-supply push has brought BPO industry to an exciting inflexion point. For last three quarters, US respondents have been saying that outsourcing partners are able to meet their business objectives.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, in order to drive organizational agility, encourage top-line growth, reduce operational cost and enjoy greater efficiency, 90% of companies today use some form of outsourcing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, BPO no longer serves one vertical – rather, it is an amalgamation of various verticals such as <b>Financial and Accounting, HR Outsourcing, Mortgage Services, Insurance Claim Processing, Healthcare</b>, etc. Each BPO verticals have some unique characteristics, and BPOs no longer work with that cookie-cutter approach.</p>
<p><b>Industrial Challenges</b></p>
<p>Customers of today especially prefer to use technology to research, or recommend or purchase product/services. With their keen interest in use of technology and keeping the customer traits in mind, outsourcing is surely going to enjoy faster growth in 2014.</p>
<p>Let us take a quick look at the outsourcing market, their demands and challenges and how BPOs are going to accomplish them.</p>

</table>
<p><b>Driving Growth and Meeting Challenges: Experts’ Opinion</b></p>
<p>In the post-recessionary period, we already observed some shifts in the demand for outsourcing to India and the Philippines. Companies now look at these BPOs, not as a tool to save on cost, but to gain strategic advantages and bring focused growth to their respective business.</p>
<p>This year the budget will work in favor of the Asian Outsourcing business as it reflects increased market maturity, client and provider collaboration and acceptance of standard delivery model. Well, 2013 has seen a soft industry pipeline, but 2014 will gradually bring much change making the pipeline strong.</p>
<p>With the change in competitive dynamics and increase in use of automated technologies, social, mobile or data analytics, the BPO industry can expect a bigger change in the outsourcing business this year.</p>
<p>Keeping high hopes and faith on technology, Fusion concludes their pre-budget opinion for 2014.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Startups face a lot of difficulty to get the ball rolling as a business expense, and the maintenance cost crawls up over time. Startup entrepreneurs have to wear many hats at a time, as they are the sole manager of their business.</p>
<p>There are many facets in business which is time consuming and costly. Bookkeeping is one such facet that makes Startups face complexity. Bookkeeping services need expert assistance. Being a Startup it is not possible to hire a full-time accountant, it is better if you outsource the bookkeeping services.</p>
<p>At present, around 40% of businesses in the US and UK prefer to outsource their bookkeeping services. It is just not a trend, but it is cost saving and a perfect alternative to expensive in-house bookkeeping. If your business enables 30 to 60 transactions per month, then outsourcing is the only option that can help you to reduce the cost and thus lessen your effort.</p>
<p>Fusion BPO Services, the fastest growing outsourcing destination spread across four countries in the globe &#8211; USA, UK, Philippines and India provide unparallel bookkeeping services. Fusion BPO Services welcomes all Startups irrespective of their size to let them enjoy bookkeeping services at a flexible price.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why must Startups outsource?</li>
<li>How can outsourcing help Startups other than saving their money?</li>
</ul>
<p>Fusion BPO narrates the ten perfect reasons to the above questions, let us read on:</p>
<p><b>1) Reduce the Operational Cost</b></p>
<p>Staffing an in-house bookkeeper is no doubt expensive. Since, it include different direct cost such as payroll tax, medical insurance, retirement plan, expense of hiring and training along with the salary. For Startups, carrying out such a large expense is difficult.</p>
<p>With the use of outsourcing, Startups will be able to reduce the headcount of employee, avoid delays due to sick leaves, turnover and reduce the cost of associated with staffing, training and other benefits.</p>
<p><b>2) Time Saving</b></p>
<p>Most of the Startups starts prefer to do their book themselves. This deters their focus from the core business aspects. By outsourcing the accounting task, Startups can stop wasting their valuable time and concentrate on the core business tasks. Allow a professional to take care of your bookkeeping needs so you will get more time to focus on what you do best.</p>
<p><b>3) No More Errors</b></p>
<p>In a Startup business, the owner himself is the chief operational officer. Since, he or she wears too many hats from bookkeeping to marketing to sales, so it is possible to make errors. As he lacks both time and energy, it is better to outsource bookkeeping services and reduce mistakes.</p>
<p><b>4) Business Gets an Expert’s Assistance</b></p>
<p>Outsourcing your bookkeeping services gives you the instant access to expert accountants 24/7. Professional experts maintain a precise and accurate record and works quickly to keep your data up-to-date. The experts employed at Fusion have formal training and practical experience in many areas of accounting. Fusionites assist Startup business to avoid penalties with inaccurate paperwork and underpayments, thus upgrade the quality of bookkeeping.</p>
<p><b>5) Flexibility in Staffing</b></p>
<p>What can you do when your staff takes a sick leave or goes on a vacation or maternity leave? You still need to pay your bills, make deposits and fulfill the payroll. With outsourcing, you get flexibility in staffing as an outsourced bookkeeper can give you assistance anytime you desire. Fusion tailors both – short-term assistance or full-time assistance to Startups.</p>
<p><b>6) Consistency in Cash Flow</b></p>
<p>In-house bookkeeping services cannot let you save money. Outsourcing bookkeeping services will optimize the cash flow by helping delay outlays of cash as long as possible. In turn, you can encourage anyone who owes you money to pay it as soon as possible.</p>
<p><b>7) Cut the expense on Technology</b></p>
<p>When you outsource bookkeeping services, you no longer need to equip your business with oodles of technology. At Fusion, we stay equipped with updated accounting software, cloud-based accounting services that help both our clients and accountants to access records through browser allowing seamless integration of data.</p>
<p><b>8) Raise Your Efficiency</b></p>
<p>Startups can manage resources effectively by delegating bookkeeping services to experts and trained accountants who can expedite your bookkeeping job faster and in the most cost-effective way. Bookkeeping cleanup is the recent trend, which our clients at Fusion prefer to outsource as they want to trim down errors in their records.</p>
<p><b>9) Seek Sound Advice</b></p>
<p>A superior outsourcing service comes power-packed with professional resources of an accounting firm and personal attention of an advisor. Fusion BPO is the fastest growing outsourcing company who helps Startups to refine their business goals and implement steps to reach those goals.</p>
<p><b>10) Restore Peace of Mind</b></p>
