								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A lack of customer complaint is not always the best news for
a business.&nbsp; In fact, customer complaint
is good for business.&nbsp; It provides
businesses with an insight about what they need to improve or change to keep
the customers happy.</p>



<p>So, even if you get vitriol from the customer, please note
that it may contain valuable customer feedback underneath it. It is important
to remember that every negative experience can be salvaged and transformed into
an opportunity. All you need to do is to carefully asses and address every
customer complaint.</p>



<p>As per data nine out of ten times, a customer will continue
doing business with you even after a slip-up—but only if you wholly fix the
situation the first time. And therein lies the merits of dealing with the
angriest of your customers. Fusion has some nuggets of wisdom to share in this
regard that we have acquired over more than 15 years:</p>



<h3>1. Look past the rage</h3>



<p>just because your customer is spewing vitriol does not mean there
is no merit in his argument. Every argument, including the angry ones, has some
insight. It is the job of the business to listen to each of its customers and
act upon their feedback.</p>



<h3>2. Record useful complaint</h3>



<p>While helping customers is important, meeting their every
demand without a second thought is wrong.&nbsp;
It encourages some customers to demand free stuff.</p>



<p>For this reason, you need to record every customer complaint
in an organized way. Evaluate each complaint and categorize them. The key is to
make it easy, and browse-able. Give your team clear instructions to make note
of every useful complaint, and you can rest easy because you will hear about
them.</p>



<h3>3. Identify the type of customer you are communicating with</h3>



<p>You should use different tactics to deal with different
customers. And for that you need to understand the customer types. Here are the
most prominent types you will be communicating with:</p>



<ul><li><strong><em>Meek customers</em></strong> – they need probing
from your end</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Aggressive customers </em></strong>– they need to
be dealt with firm politeness</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>High roller customer</em></strong> – they pay well
and demand premium support for it. They need to be on a VIP list.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Chronic complainer</em></strong> – these customers
should be dealt with patience.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Never-happy customer</em></strong> – they need to
be dealt with as firmly as possible</li></ul>



<h3>4. Don&#8217;t be passive aggressive</h3>



<p>Say you are sorry and mean it.&nbsp; Never misuse the tone and sound dismissive
while apologizing to the customers. They will appreciate your apology.</p>



<h3>5. Transfer calls only after some explanation</h3>



<p>no one likes their calls to get transferred. Therefore, if you have to do it, kindly provide the customer with an explanation. this will help you earn their trust.</p>



<p>Follow these simple rules while talking to the angriest customer. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While customer survey is a useful way to gather a large volume of data in a very short span of time, creating a useful customer survey is not an easy task. Companies must be careful while creating a customer survey. You can also ask for the help of your <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/call-center.html">call center service provider</a> in creating the perfect survey.&nbsp; Having experience in conducting numerous surveys, call center service providers possess a deep understanding of what a successful customer survey should look like and can help you with not only creating such surveys but also see it become successful. </p>



<p>When it comes to creating the perfect customer survey,
Fusion has a set of ten rules.&nbsp; Using
these 10 easy tips it has helped a number of businesses achieve their desired
results.&nbsp; What to know about them? Read
on: &#8211; </p>



<h3>1. Keep it Short</h3>



<p>A short survey is often a successful one.&nbsp; Your survey should be clear and concise. You
must find the shortest way to ask questions that get you the total answer.&nbsp; Eliminate superfluous phrasing, reduce the
character count and try everything you can to keep it short. A short survey
often has the lowest abandon rate. After all, no one wants to answer a
questionnaire for 30 minutes and more.</p>



<h3>2. Ask questions with a purpose only</h3>



<p>Don’t hesitate about cutting unnecessary questions from your
surveys. Every question in your survey must have a clear purpose and a good
reason to be there.&nbsp; If not, chuck it
out. If you can monitor the channel through which the customer came to your
site, do not hesitate to cut it out of the survey. These questions make the
survey lengthy and make customers abandon the survey. </p>



<h3>3. Create open-ended questions</h3>



<p>Sure, multiple choice questions look tempting, but to get
insightful feedback open-ended questions are your best bet. It will allow you
to know what your customers are really thinking. But do not ask questions that
may come with a big, lengthy answer. It’s best to take on brief questions first
to create a sense of progress, and then give your customers the opportunity to
elaborate on their thoughts.</p>



<p>Fusion plans a question with a simple introduction, and then follow up the answer with an open-ended question such as, “<em>Why is that so?</em>”</p>



<h3>4. One question at a time</h3>



<p>Bombarding your customer with so many questions at once is
never a good idea and yet we see it in many such surveys. It feels like being
interrogated by someone who won’t want to listen to you. For quality responses,
your customers need time to think and you have to give them that.&nbsp; If you keep asking multiple questions at one
go, you will get half-hearted answers because at that point your customer is
just looking for a way to get to the end. </p>



<h3>5. Make scales consistent</h3>



<p>We often come across surveys that have very confusing usage
of common scales under a different context.&nbsp;
</p>



<p>For example – initially, you are to rate an experience between 1-5, with 1 being “Poor” and 5 being &#8220;excellent&#8221;. Later in the survey, you are to evaluate the importance of certain things, in which 1 means the most important and 5 means less so. </p>



<p>&nbsp;This is utterly
confusing to a customer.&nbsp; A customer may
completely miss the change and give an inaccurate answer to the same.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/survey.jpg" alt="Customer Survey" class="wp-image-6449" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/survey.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/survey-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<h3>6. Avoid loaded questions</h3>



<p>Do not ask questions with a bias in their phrasing that may
lead respondents towards a particular answer.&nbsp;
It will not get you the result you are looking for. Clip the language
that can influence a respondent’s thinking into answering in a certain way. </p>



<p>For example – “<em>What do you think of our award-winning popular children book series?</em>” is not the way to ask questions in surveys. You would get a far honest answer if you ask “<em>what do you think about our children book series?</em>”</p>



<p>While the first question in the example will earn you
supporters who tell you what you want to hear, the second question will get you
closer to the real scenario. So, in case you want to get a real picture, stir
clear of those adjectives and specialties unless absolutely necessary.</p>



<h3>7. Use Yes/No questions</h3>



<p>If a question can be answered in yes/no, try to frame the
question that way. These close-ended questions make great starter questions for
a survey as they are easier to evaluate and complete. </p>



<h3>8. Avoid assumptions</h3>



<p>If you create questions assuming that all the customers are
knowledgeable about something, you will have problems. Keep a check on your
language and terminology and stir clear of industry jargons, references, and
acronyms. </p>



<p>Rather you can ask customers about their opinion on one
subject and ask them to be specific. It will get you a far better response.</p>



<h3>9. Timing matters</h3>



<p>Time is crucial in a customer survey. In most cases,
companies conduct customer surveys once per quarter.&nbsp; But waiting that long to know the pulse of
the customer does not seem enough. You need to conduct small but potent surveys
at regular intervals to get the real picture. Alternatively, you can gather the
idea by looking at customer satisfaction rating and other metrics. </p>



<h3>10. Entice them with bonus</h3>



<p>Enticing the customers with an incentive can increase the
participation rate. It can be a discount, account credit or a giveaway. One may
think that incentive may influence the quality of responses, but it is likely
not to be the case. Also, see whether you can financially handle the incentive
and then proceed. </p>



<p>These are the ten tips that Fusion follows for improving
customer surveys on behalf of its clients. Numerous of our clients benefitted
from our deep insight into customer survey domain.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Customers today are exposed to the gold standard of customer service and hence expect nothing but the best experience from a business. Therefore, providing <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/services.html">outstanding customer service</a> round the clock in a call center environment has become a must for every business. It helps you stay ahead of your competition, retain your customers, and even win over new customers. But there’s a secret ingredient in this recipe for success that distinguishes the greats from the ordinary. And that is – personalized customer service. </p>



<p>&nbsp;By personalizing
customer service, you start treating people as people and not as just a
customer. A little personalization can go a long way empowering your customers
and lead to customer loyalty, confident agents, higher sales, and better
competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Wondering how to add personalization to your call center
customer service? Here are a few tips:</p>



<h3>1. Use Automation</h3>



<p><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/will-ai-replace-or-enhance-a-call-center.html">Automation can be a great tool to personalize customer service</a>. Automation can help your agents save time to provide one-on-one care to customers who need that. Automation or AI can be used to:</p>



<ul><li>route customers to the right department
intelligently</li><li>collect necessary data before starting a voice
interaction</li><li>Share real-time information between agents or
teams</li></ul>



<p>Chatbots, CRM integrations, scripts, and other automation
tools can help make the lives of customer service agents a lot easier.</p>



<h3>2. Create full customer profiles</h3>



<p>Creating profiles of your customer groups will help you understand your customers better. You will be able to see their motivations in a customer service environment and make informed decisions. You will be able to take a look at your customer data from the marketing team to understand your customer demographic and develop accurate profiles with personalized information.</p>



<p>These profiles will help you offer more personalized service to your customers. And the personalized the care, the greater is the chance of customer satisfaction.</p>



<h3>3. Use optimized scripts</h3>



<p>At first glance, script and personalized customer service do
not seem to gel well. But scripts can truly be the key to delivering a
high-quality personalized customer experience. Using a call center scripting
software, you can now customize and deploy script. While features like CRM
integration and others help your agents and customers get what they need in one
place.&nbsp; </p>



<p>An integrated call script can help agents big time. They can simply follow a guided session that links to their preferred CRM and deliver personalized customer service. They can provide feedback on the efficacy of a particular script and can even improve on that.</p>



<p>This way, you can get a tested, observed and approved a script that can satisfy your customer, increase the efficiency of your agents, drive brand loyalty and positive conversion. That is the reason Fusion believes, a high performing script is a key to success.</p>



<h3>4. Offer Multichannel and Self-service support options</h3>



<p>Personalized customer service is all about empowering your
customers and valuing their choices. Not every customer is comfortable with the
same communication channels and therefore you should provide them solutions
through the communication channel of their choice.</p>



<p>Offering <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-omnichannel-customer-service-best-practices-to-boost-customer-experience.html">multichannel service</a> for finding solutions, answering queries, troubleshooting, and contacting the right team sends your customer the message that you are rooting for them. Offering self-service is personalization at its best. Here are a few communication channels that you can provide service through:&nbsp; </p>



<ul><li>phone</li><li><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/looking-to-improve-email-customer-support-heres-how-we-do-it.html">email </a></li><li><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/how-to-provide-good-live-chat-support-to-your-customers.html">live chat</a></li><li><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/12-tips-for-enhanced-customer-service-through-social-media.html">social media</a></li><li>self-service support options</li></ul>



<p>With consumers preferring self-service support, you should
start offering a personalized self-service option that helps customers quickly
and easily find the answer they need. It makes the customers happy and takes
the stress away from your call center and sales team.</p>



<h3>5. Be a Human</h3>



<p>&nbsp;In order to win your
customers being a human is as important as personalization.&nbsp; Your customers should never feel like they
are talking to robots, even if they initially interacted with one.&nbsp; Personalized customer service training must
involve ways of responding like a human, dealing with emotions, and working
through different customer scenarios. Training your agents to deal with all
these will go a long way in creating a personalized and productive customer
experience. </p>



<p>While providing your customers with a seamless personalized
service experience involves many factors, it is not very difficult to achieve.
You just have to know your customers and meet their needs with different
customer support tools and automation. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The hospitality industry has performed very well in the past
few years and it is expected to have robust growth in this financial period as
well.&nbsp; Thanks to increasing income levels
in emerging markets and the current global economy, the hospitality industry
has come across a sea of opportunities. As corporate travels, adventure
holidays, and leisure trips increases, the hospitality industry must also gear
up to meet the ever-increasing expectations of their customers. </p>



<p>To present the customers with a wonderful experience, the
hospitality industry must put more emphasis on customer service. As customers
today are exposed to the gold standard of customer service, they can no longer
be sated with good food and a comfortable bed. They want much more – they expect
a hospitality business to provide them with a seamless experience in everything
from interactions to services. </p>



<p>For this reason, more and more hospitality businesses are
trying hard to provide excellent customer service to make their customers happy
about their overall experience. That is not, however, an easy task to do,
especially in the wake of the ever-changing demands of customers today. In
fact, it can turn into a time-consuming, costly affair that can shift the
business’s focus from its core operations and ruin the entire experience for a
customer.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Instead, a hospitality business can outsource some of its non-core operations to a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/travel-transportation-hospitality.html">BPO with experience of serving hospitality businesses</a> in the past.&nbsp; Numerous hospitality industry leaders have successfully outsourced some of their non-core operations to improve the quality of customer experience.&nbsp; Here are a number of services hospitality businesses from across the globe are outsourcing to a BPO without compromising on their customer experience. </p>



<h3>Multilingual Call Center Services</h3>



<p>Today most hotels have an international clientele and in order to make things easy for them a standard hotel can team up with a multilingual call center.&nbsp; This way, when a prospect or customer makes some inquiries regarding booking from another part of the world, a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html">multilingual customer service team</a> can answer them in the customer’s own language on a 24/7 basis. When a hotel provides convenient communication channels with ready assistance to any nationality, it creates a positive impression in the eyes of foreign guests.</p>



<h3>Booking and Reservation Services</h3>



<p>BPOs can help a hotel or restaurant manage their booking and
reservation duties.&nbsp; Equipped with
multi-channel capabilities, call centers can support customer queries, booking
and reservations across a number of channels, such as – voice call, chat,
email, and through an online portal. Most customers today expect quick answers
regarding room availability and reservations, as well as service/facility rates
from the business website or customer service department. And providing them
the answers pronto often deemed as quality customer service that adds brownie
points to the customer experience. </p>



<h3>Reception Services</h3>



<p>While the company’s front desk should be managed by a receptionist, a hospitality business may still excel its customer experience by outsourcing its reception services. Upon outsourcing, the offshore receptionists can answer and route every incoming call whereas the onsite receptionist can focus on attending guests.&nbsp; This way, a customer no longer has to wait for the front desk receptionist to be free to take their calls and can get their issues and requirements resolved quickly and efficiently. It leads to greater customer satisfaction and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-omnichannel-customer-service-best-practices-to-boost-customer-experience.html">richer customer experience</a>. </p>



<h3>Research and Analytics</h3>



<p>While expanding its horizon or entering a new market a
hospitality business needs to have a good idea about what the customers want,
to deliver a quality customer service and a great customer experience. In such
a situation, hiring a BPO to do consumer behavior research, market research and
analytics would be far cost-effective a solution that carrying out the research
with an in-house team. The professional researchers from a BPO will be able to
provide them with a detailed report of the scenario and help them make informed
decisions. Such researches will also help a hospitality business shape their
customer experience. </p>



<p>Hoteliers, restaurateurs, and spa-owners can use outsourcing to cut costs and improve the quality of their services at the same time. When a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com">professional customer service call center</a> handles some of the customer service duties of hospitality business, it becomes easier to serve the guests in person and through various other communication channels. That is the right way to woo an ever-connected consumer base. </p>



<p>As a multilingual multi-channel BPO service provider Fusion efficiently supports English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin and others &#8211; through various communication channels and can, therefore, support any customer service process of a hospitality business. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gone are the days when retail businesses were purely
brick-and-mortar. Thanks to new technology, the rise of internet and the
changes in the spending habits of its consumers, retail industry went through
some drastic changes in recent years. </p>



<p>And as the boundaries between retail and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/ecommerce.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ecommerce (opens in a new tab)">ecommerce</a> are blurring, consumers’ expectations from a retail business is growing dramatically. Consumers today expect service from a wide variety of channels from a retail business including in-store, online, and over the phone. This has increased the challenges for retail businesses all around.</p>



<p>To meet these ever-growing challenges and succeed, retail
businesses can get help from call center outsourcing. In fact, hiring a call
center can have multiple benefits for a retail business.&nbsp; Here are they:</p>



<h3>1. Provide Better
Customer Support</h3>



<p>Retail businesses can provide better service for their
customers by taking a proactive approach and using multiple channels. &nbsp;With an outsourced call center that is
designed and equipped to handle a variety of customer issues, the process of
customer service becomes much more efficient. Also, the likelihood of customer
problems or complaints being resolved quickly is much greater with a
professional call center. When customers feel satisfied with the support, it creates
greater loyalty which can translate into future sales.</p>



<h3>2. Meet Customers on
Their Terms</h3>



<p>When a customer has a problem, issue, or question, they want
to be able to receive service immediately. To meet that expectation, retail
businesses need to provide 24/7 service through a variety of communication
channels, which is something that call centers can make possible.</p>



<h3>3. Increase Brand
Presence</h3>



<p>In today’s business world, reaching customers and increasing your brand presence needs to include a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/how-to-change-into-a-multi-channel-call-center-tips.html">multi-channel approach</a>. Call center services use a variety of channels (as voice, e-mail, live-chat and a variety of social media platforms) to increase awareness about your business and raise your retail presence. Equipped to handle so many channels, the contact center can handle multiple customer queries across every available channel your customer uses.</p>



<h3>4. Boost Customer
Experience</h3>



<p>By using call center services, a retail business can reach the right customer, through the right channel, with the right message at the right time and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-ways-to-boost-customer-experience-through-call-center.html">offer greater customer experience</a>. Also, timely customer service round the clock means better customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>



<h3>5. Provide Big Data
Collection and Analysis</h3>



<p>Call center technology provides clear metrics and data
analysis in real time. Call centers can quickly provide feedback on data that
would need to be measured. This type of data collection and analysis enables
the retailer to make required adjustments to make the business successful. </p>



<h3>6. Allow Businesses
to Focus on Core</h3>



<p>Setting up and operating in-house customer service can be tough
and time-consuming for retail businesses. By using a call center, businesses
can focus more on their products, daily operations, and business plans, without
the worry about customer service.</p>



<h3>7. Cost-Effective</h3>



<p>Call center services are often more cost-effective than
providing in-house services for retail businesses. Many call centers offer
affordable rates, customized solutions, and scalable service, and therefore can
provide cost-effective service for growing or expanding businesses. </p>



<p>These are a few benefits a retail business can reap by
hiring an outsourcing call center.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>First contact resolution (FCR) is a critical key performance indicator (<a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-technologies-boost-up-the-kpi.html">KPI</a>) in measuring both the quality of the customer experience as well as the efficiency of a contact center. According to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/increase-efficiency-drive-down-cost-and-improve-customer-satisfaction-all-at-the-same-time/">research</a>, a 1% improvement in FCR can mean a 1% improvement in customer satisfaction, too. However, it can be a challenge both in terms of measurement and continuous improvement.</p>



<p>When a customer has to repeatedly contact a business to resolve an issue, they get frustrated and very disappointed with the service.  On the contrary, when an agent resolves the issue in the very first contact, it creates a better customer experience and marks the operational efficiency of a call center.</p>



<p>Measurement of first contact resolution typically comes down to the customers’ feedback on whether the inquiry was resolved to their satisfaction. You may need to use a number of different tracking methods in order to capture this information.</p>



<p>With a little effort from your end, FCR can be boosted.  Want to know about them? Here we have 8 ways to improve your call center FCR:</p>



<h2>1. Train call center agents to handle most queries</h2>



<p>A skills matrix helps you see the abilities of your agents at a glance. Training programs need to be tailored accordingly with the goal of nurturing and developing your team. A knowledge base for frequently asked questions can help less skilled agents can easily find out ways to resolve common issues.</p>



<h2>2. Use call routing technology to find the right agent on the first call</h2>



<p>Skill-based routing should be there to ensure customers are matched up with the best agent for the call.  Calls should be based on language proficiency or product knowledge and aligned your agents’ skills in real-time. Intelligent call routing or data-directed routing lets you interrogate data within your CRM and factor it into the routing process. </p>



<p>This way, a customer with an ongoing, active complaint could be routed directly to a supervisor. Immediate callbacks to customers who abandon a queue or get disconnected can also help you turn bad customer experience into a service recovery opportunity.</p>



<h2>3. Eliminate conflicting KPIs that could work against FCR</h2>



<p>If your staff is being measured for Average Handle Time (AHT), it can have a negative impact on successful First Call Resolution. It happens quite often and therefore needs addressing. Eliminating these conflicting KPIs can help agents focus on FCR.</p>



<h2>4. Use Incentive to boost FCR</h2>



<p>Make your agents aware of the importance of first contact resolution and good customer service. If you want your agents to focus on FCR, it needs to be deeply ingrained within the company culture. You can use incentives to motivate agents to perform against your FCR goals.</p>



<h2>5. Measure First Call Resolution consistently</h2>



<p>A sophisticated call recording system is essential to quality monitoring and call ratings. However, post-call customer surveys too can be used for measuring first call resolution as only the customer can provide an honest perspective on whether they feel their issue has been resolved. Asking the customers about their experience on social media too can help you get an honest answer. You need to adopt a multi-touchpoint approach to measuring first contact resolution to get the correct picture of customer satisfaction.</p>



<h2>6. Encourage feedback from staff</h2>



<p>Encourage staff feedback and make it a part of your operation.  It will help you understand whether an issue is recurring or not. Acting upon the inputs from the agents will help you nip a recurring problem at the bud.</p>



<h2>7. Check your IVR system</h2>



<p>You should review your IVR system from time to time to ensure that it is up-t-date and getting the right customer to the right place without delay.</p>



<h2>8. Tweak the scripting process to boost FCR</h2>



<p>Dynamic agent scripting that integrates with your <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/can-you-build-better-call-center-metrics-with-crm.html">CRM system can help</a> agents to adequately handle customer issues during the first call resolution.</p>



<p>These are the eight ways you can work on to improve your call center FCR, efficiency, and customer experience.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A well-managed and efficient call center can be a big help
in making the business get more customers and retain the existing ones. They
are directly responsible for maintaining the company’s image in the eyes of the
target clientele. </p>



<p>A call center agent is often the first point of contact for
the customers. therefore, they must shoulder the responsibility of customer
satisfaction and deliver best in class service. While there is no absolute
formula to deliver the best customer experience, a few tried and tested methods
can ensure that every client interaction ends in a positive note for the
customer as well as for the agent.</p>



<p>It goes without saying that customer experience is going to
be the buzzword in 2019. Here is why:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">86%</a>
of buyers are willing to pay more for a great customer experience</li><li><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/future-of-customer-experience.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">73%</a>
of buyers point to customer experience as an important factor in purchasing
decisions</li><li><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/advisory-services/publications/consumer-intelligence-series/pwc-consumer-intelligence-series-customer-experience.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">65%</a>
of buyers find a positive experience with a brand to be more influential than
great advertising</li></ul>



<p>So, can a call center <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html">deliver positive customer experience</a> that matters? Yes, it can. Here are 5 easy steps for improving the experience of the customers interacting with a call center:</p>



<h3>1. Minimum On-Hold
Times during Calls</h3>



<p>Putting a customer on-hold for a long period of time is a
call center bane that drives customers crazy.&nbsp;
The customers do not like to stay on hold, period. They don’t care if
their issues actually need time to be resolved and the agent can’t help but
make them wait.&nbsp; To most of them a call
center should be a one-stop solution for all their problems. They want a quick
solution and they want it right now. </p>



<p>While eliminating waiting time is impossible, a call center
must try to keep the on-hold time to a bare minimum. Remember, the shorted the
wait time, the happier a customer is.&nbsp;
It’s that simple.</p>



<h3>2. Understand who the
customers are</h3>



<p>Knowing a customer demographic is not enough, you customer
service teams must also know who are their customers. Try putting a face to
your customer or creating customer personas – it will help your customer
service team to understand your customers better.</p>



<p>Your customer personas can be as detailed as you want them
to be. By creating personas, your agents can put a face to their customers and
better understand how they can assist and improve customer experience.</p>



<h3>3. Recognize the
stage of customer journey for each customer</h3>



<p>A call center agent must not interact with each customer the
same way. Rather they should use the CRM to pinpoint the stage of every
customers’ journey and personalize their interaction to improve the customer
experience.</p>



<p>Define the customer actions that fall within each stage of
the customer journey. This will help your call center customer service team to
quickly recognize and know how to approach your leads and clients.</p>



<h3>4. Forge an emotional
bond</h3>



<p>The biggest chunk of consumers today are millennials. And
millennials don’t just look for a product, they want their values to be aligned
with the brands they shop from. They want value for money, as well as great customer
experience.</p>



<p>While pricing is not something your customer service team
can control, they can deliver everything else.&nbsp;
They can forge an emotional connection with the customer by empathizing
with them, telling them their side of story and even throwing in a
much-appreciated surprise.&nbsp; This
connection will help your agents anticipate the customers’ needs better and
deliver a much better experience.</p>



<h3>5. Make it easy for
customers</h3>



<p>In this age of competition, customers are being spoiled with
one-click checkout, instant customer service through chatbots, next-day
shipping. These services simplify the purchase process for customers and reduce
customer effort in an attempt to maximize sales. A customer service team too
can reduce customer effort in so many ways. They can- </p>



<ul><li>Offer to call back in case of disconnection</li><li>Clearly Understand customer queries </li><li>See to it that the customers do not have to
repeat themselves</li><li>Provide helpful material after service</li><li>Solve customers’ issues the first time around</li><li>Offer to answer a customer query through the
preferred communication channel of a customer</li></ul>



<p>A customer service team can make the process of purchase or
issue resolution a cakewalk for the customers, resulting in a high-quality
customer experience.&nbsp; </p>



<p>In todays competitive world customer experience is gold. Being
the first point of contact for customers, it is up to the call center customer
service team to deliver the customer experience each customer deserves. While
their interactions can be short, it can be an excellent opportunity to boost
customer experience.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While call center management is a mammoth task, following the latest and most innovative trends can help a call center keep delivering quality customer service to its customers. And while trends come and go with each passing year, only the most effective ones can help a call center improve. </p>



<p>As 2019 is approaching, one must look into the call center trends that will have a big impact on call centers the coming year. </p>



<h2>Trend 1: Customer Experience is of Prime Importance</h2>



<p>By now every call center should be aware of the power of a positive customer experience. </p>



<p>From the biggest corporations to the smallest businesses today know that a poor customer experience is all it takes to lose a customer forever while consistent bad service can ruin any business for good, especially with so many competitors around.</p>



<p>On the other hand, customers today are willing to pay more for better service. According to one <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/RightNow/2011-customer-experience-impact-report">survey</a> 86% of buyers would part with 25% extra cash if another company treated them better.</p>



<p>For this reason, customer experience has become an important aspect that call centers can no longer ignore. On the contrary, they are placing more and more emphasis on treating each caller to the highest standard of service to ensure repeat business. </p>



<h2>Trend 2: The Importance of First Call Resolution </h2>



<p>First call resolution is great for both the call center and the customers alike. </p>



<p>For this, agents should be encouraged to get the first call right. While there will be calls that are more difficult to resolve than others, it’s important to provide customers with the very best quality of care possible every single time.</p>



<p>Monitoring call center agents’ interactions with customers will help a business identify mistakes that leaves the caller unsatisfied and/or frustrated.  With proper identification and training such problems can be avoided in future. </p>



<h2>Trend 3: Social Network is an Important Customer Service Channel</h2>



<p>Social networks like Facebook and Twitter continue to become a key channel in customer service.</p>



<p>As an alternative to calling or emailing, prospective and existing buyers can contact a business’s support team through their social accounts. Call centers should be incorporating this aspect of the customer experience into their operations to make sure that the consumers can reach them on as many channels as possible.</p>



<p>Handling queries through various social media channels can actually be the fastest method. However, as the conversation takes place in a public forum, one must bear the best practices in mind.  On social media quick and efficient responses are the key. Ignoring this channel, on the other hand, can ruin a company’s brand reputation. </p>



<h2>Trend 4: Every Channel Matters</h2>



<p>Customers today expect companies to respond through the same channel they use to interact with the company. So, if they interact with a call center via phone or chat, they would not appreciate the company replying through email.</p>



<p>Therefore, call centers should be ready to incorporate that aspect of customer experience into their operation and give equal importance to all customer interaction channels.  Only then they will be able to provide the customers with the multi-channel customer service that modern customers deserve.</p>



<h2>Trend 5: Employee Management</h2>



<p>Most of the time call centers fail to meet customer’s needs due to disengaged agents who lack power and freedom to improvise or take a decision. Therefore, empowering the agents with knowledge, giving them some decision making freedom and engaging them through a reward-based culture is very important. A company can also arrange for interim training wherever needed to train their agents better.</p>



<p>These are some of the most important call center trends that will help a call center to become successful in 2019 and beyond. </p>

		<title>Will AI (Artificial Intelligence) Replace Or Enhance A Call Center?</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this age of technology, we move towards a day when all our problems can be resolved at the press of a button. However, such a day of instant quality solutions to the difficult problem is still a distant dream. However, some think that the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) will change the whole call center scenario and replace the human agents for a faster, quicker and richer customer experience.</p>
<p>We are already seeing AI at work at some of the biggest brands. IVR and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-chatbots-reshaping-customer-service-kishore-saraogi/">chatbots have already become very popular</a> as a customer service solution. But they cannot offer a solution to all the issues a customer might face. And as of now AI also lacks the human touch that most customers want.</p>
<p>Therefore, even when many see AI as a saving grace that replaces human agent but keeps the human touch, the reality is far from it. While most AI systems (IVR, Live chat system etc.) can resolve the basic queries, they do not have the machine learning capabilities to offer solutions to complex problems. Sure, the data shows that AI has been extremely helpful at times, but to call it a savior would be an exaggeration. You can call AI a performance enhancer for the contact center, not a replacement.</p>
<p>Here are five reasons why AI will not replace a call center in near future:</p>
<h2>1) AI is extremely expensive to fully implement</h2>
<p>As the popularity of AI in customer service increases, many small and medium businesses start worrying about how much money they have to spend to meet the customers’ need for a faster solution that only AI can offer. While you want good CSAT scores by meeting customer expectations and providing them with good customer experience, you should also ask yourself whether it is worth shelling thousands of dollars on an AI system just to meet customer expectations.</p>
<p>Knowing your customer base is the key here. While a business with a younger customer base may want to choose AI over call center as young customers want a prompt solution to their problems, businesses with older customer base would do well by sticking to contact centers. According to SoftwareAdvice, <a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/industryview/big-data-report-2015/" rel="nofollow">63%</a> of people over the age of 35 prefer human interaction in the form of a phone call compared to an automated live chat.</p>
<h2>2) Contact Center AI technology is not up to the mark &#8211; yet</h2>
<p>Properly setting up the systems that require AI and the automation that encompasses it takes a vast amount of resources including money. And yet, today most AI systems do not have machine learning capabilities that help a customer find the exact solution they are looking for. Today AI is in a place where it is nothing more than a system that pulls from a database. If the customer query fetches the wrong result, then the customer has to go back and put a new set of keywords. The machine and AI today does not have a self-taught system that is smart enough to correct itself.</p>
<h2>3) AI can streamline your lower level inquiries</h2>
<p>People still prefer human agents over automation in sales and customer support. But <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-replace-human-agents-call-centers-future-kishore-saraogi/">AI can make the lives easier for customer support agents</a>. You can set up an online FAQ form or get a system with IVR capabilities to streamline the regular queries and basic solutions. It will ensure that the customers call your contact center only when it is necessary and urgent.</p>
<h2>4) Technology today requires sophisticated answers</h2>
<p>The problems or pre-smart gadgets era were far less complex than the issues of today. As the technology advances, its issues grow more complex, and their solutions, therefore, have to be more sophisticated. And only a real live human agent can provide you with the solution as of now.</p>
<p>There is no way you can tackle the vast possibilities of customer queries through FAQ page, IVR or chat. The complex the problems, the more you need a human to resolve it.</p>
<h2>5) AI is a complement to contact center operations</h2>
<p>Today most contact center solutions offer a number of automation features that SMBs want to achieve through AI including &#8211; IVR and advance scripting. These features can definitely improve your contact center operations. But it is not yet in a position to replace it.</p>
<p>AI is still not in a position where it can replace a contact center. While it can definitely act as a performance enhancer and complement your call center operations, it still requires a lot of time and resources to implement. In addition to that, AI is not in a position to resolve complex queries – that power still remains with the human contact center agents. So, it can be said, AI has miles to go before it can become a successor of the contact center, if at all.</p>
