<p>With self-service on the rise, many people believe that the
time is up for live human agents who have been the backbone of call center and
customer service industry. Fusion respectfully begs to differ. </p>



<p>Having more than 15 years of experience in the call center
industry, we have studied consumer behavior closely. And while customer support
has changed a lot over the years thanks to technological advancements like
self-service and AI, live agents still remain the most preferred choice for
customer support, especially in the complex cases. </p>



<p>Here are a few of our observations on the role of live
agents in the modern customer service industry:</p>



<h3>1. People Still Want To Interact With A Human Agent</h3>



<p>Customer service encounters through social media or self-service don’t always leave customers feeling great confidence. On the other hand, interacting with a fellow human can make your customers feel reassured. </p>



<p>Even the tech-savvy <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/provide-quality-customer-service-to-the-millennials.html">millennials</a> who prefer self-service and other technology-rich customer service channels, resort to interacting with live customer service agents via voice or <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">chat</a> when they face a complex issue.  </p>



<p>Therefore, live agents are still very much relevant in the modern customer service scene and if anything, they play a far more significant role today than the role it used to play earlier.</p>



<h3>2. Customers Want Easy Access To Live Agents</h3>



<p>No matter how technologically advanced a call center becomes, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/engage-your-agents-xfactor-quality-customer-experience.html">there is no alternative of human agents</a>.  Even today, customers are more comfortable to convey their unique issues to a human agent than to a chatbot or IVR. Therefore, customers must be given the choice to talk to a live human agent and the option should be clearly conveyed to the customer. Many businesses these days think so as well.</p>



<p>In the Customer Contact Week Digital market study, <a href="https://www.customercontactweekdigital.com/content-auto-download/5be9b822d1d92e406f3b64d1">64%</a> of respondents agreed that customers must have easy access to a live human agent.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY.jpg" alt="THE FUTURE OF THE CONTACT CENTER IN 2019" class="wp-image-6593" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY.jpg 801w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-300x285.jpg 300w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-768x729.jpg 768w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-750x712.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></figure>



<p>As a call center with over 15 years of experience, Fusion has also seen that a customer is far more comfortable in discussing their issues with a human agent than telling it all to a faceless machine entity. They crave for the empathy that only a live human agent can deliver.</p>



<h3>3. Live Agents Can Handle Complex Issues Better</h3>



<p>All the issues handled by customer service can predominantly
be classified into two groups –</p>



<ul><li>Simple issues or inquiries </li><li>Complex problems</li></ul>



<p>Simple issues can be defined as issues that can be handled
within a single interaction or a basic issue reporting that can be resolved by
the company without additional customer input. These issues generally are
frequent and reoccurring and therefore, addressing them with automated channels
like knowledge-based systems, social media, improved website forms, text
messages, and chat systems makes complete sense. </p>



<p>However, when the problem is complex, automated channels fail to effectively resolve them. For this reason, most complex issues are handled over the phone.</p>



<p>It takes more time to explain the problem in detail so that the customer service agent can understand it, analyze it, and work on providing the resolution. However, the process can be improved by integrating AI with human agents.</p>



<h3>4. Artificial Intelligence Should Complement Human Agents Instead Of Replacing Them</h3>



<p>While <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Artificial Intelligence (opens in a new tab)">Artificial Intelligence</a> or AI is the buzzword in modern customer support, it is still not in a position where it can replace a human agent. AI is to go a long way before it can master the art of natural language processing (NLP) and empathy. Instead, it can be used to aid a live agent and make their job easier.  </p>



<p>For example – if one of your customers has an issue
regarding their bills, a live agent will take some time to find relevant
information. &nbsp;When AI is brought into the
scene, it will be able to show the agent the past interaction history on the
screen along with itemized billing so that it becomes easier for the agent to
promptly resolve the issue and ask about the previous issue the customer
faced.&nbsp; It will up the customer
satisfaction level.&nbsp; </p>



<h4>Conclusion: </h4>



<p>Human agents were, are, and will be occupying the central position of the customer service industry.  The chance of AI replacing live agents looks very slim in the near future as AI needs a lot of improvement to be at par with a human agent in terms of emotional intelligence. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The hospitality industry has performed very well in the past
few years and it is expected to have robust growth in this financial period as
well.&nbsp; Thanks to increasing income levels
in emerging markets and the current global economy, the hospitality industry
has come across a sea of opportunities. As corporate travels, adventure
holidays, and leisure trips increases, the hospitality industry must also gear
up to meet the ever-increasing expectations of their customers. </p>



<p>To present the customers with a wonderful experience, the
hospitality industry must put more emphasis on customer service. As customers
today are exposed to the gold standard of customer service, they can no longer
be sated with good food and a comfortable bed. They want much more – they expect
a hospitality business to provide them with a seamless experience in everything
from interactions to services. </p>



<p>For this reason, more and more hospitality businesses are
trying hard to provide excellent customer service to make their customers happy
about their overall experience. That is not, however, an easy task to do,
especially in the wake of the ever-changing demands of customers today. In
fact, it can turn into a time-consuming, costly affair that can shift the
business’s focus from its core operations and ruin the entire experience for a
customer.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Instead, a hospitality business can outsource some of its non-core operations to a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/travel-transportation-hospitality.html">BPO with experience of serving hospitality businesses</a> in the past.&nbsp; Numerous hospitality industry leaders have successfully outsourced some of their non-core operations to improve the quality of customer experience.&nbsp; Here are a number of services hospitality businesses from across the globe are outsourcing to a BPO without compromising on their customer experience. </p>



<h3>Multilingual Call Center Services</h3>



<p>Today most hotels have an international clientele and in order to make things easy for them a standard hotel can team up with a multilingual call center.&nbsp; This way, when a prospect or customer makes some inquiries regarding booking from another part of the world, a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html">multilingual customer service team</a> can answer them in the customer’s own language on a 24/7 basis. When a hotel provides convenient communication channels with ready assistance to any nationality, it creates a positive impression in the eyes of foreign guests.</p>



<h3>Booking and Reservation Services</h3>



<p>BPOs can help a hotel or restaurant manage their booking and
reservation duties.&nbsp; Equipped with
multi-channel capabilities, call centers can support customer queries, booking
and reservations across a number of channels, such as – voice call, chat,
email, and through an online portal. Most customers today expect quick answers
regarding room availability and reservations, as well as service/facility rates
from the business website or customer service department. And providing them
the answers pronto often deemed as quality customer service that adds brownie
points to the customer experience. </p>



<h3>Reception Services</h3>



<p>While the company’s front desk should be managed by a receptionist, a hospitality business may still excel its customer experience by outsourcing its reception services. Upon outsourcing, the offshore receptionists can answer and route every incoming call whereas the onsite receptionist can focus on attending guests.&nbsp; This way, a customer no longer has to wait for the front desk receptionist to be free to take their calls and can get their issues and requirements resolved quickly and efficiently. It leads to greater customer satisfaction and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-omnichannel-customer-service-best-practices-to-boost-customer-experience.html">richer customer experience</a>. </p>



<h3>Research and Analytics</h3>



<p>While expanding its horizon or entering a new market a
hospitality business needs to have a good idea about what the customers want,
to deliver a quality customer service and a great customer experience. In such
a situation, hiring a BPO to do consumer behavior research, market research and
analytics would be far cost-effective a solution that carrying out the research
with an in-house team. The professional researchers from a BPO will be able to
provide them with a detailed report of the scenario and help them make informed
decisions. Such researches will also help a hospitality business shape their
customer experience. </p>



<p>Hoteliers, restaurateurs, and spa-owners can use outsourcing to cut costs and improve the quality of their services at the same time. When a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com">professional customer service call center</a> handles some of the customer service duties of hospitality business, it becomes easier to serve the guests in person and through various other communication channels. That is the right way to woo an ever-connected consumer base. </p>



<p>As a multilingual multi-channel BPO service provider Fusion efficiently supports English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin and others &#8211; through various communication channels and can, therefore, support any customer service process of a hospitality business. </p>

<p>In recent years, the airlines industry has faced major
challenges like rising fuel cost, changes in environmental regulations, and an
ever-rising customer expectation. To cope with them, most airlines are looking
for ways to reduce cost while meeting the environmental regulations and
customer expectations. </p>

offer the airlines industry fast and simple solutions that help small and
medium airlines survive the tumulus time and prepare them for future growth and

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you remember the opening scenes of Wall-E? It shows a grotesque future of our beloved planet &#8211; uninhabitable, with mounds of waste everywhere, devoid of a single sign of life. That’s the future that awaits us if we do not pay attention to our responsibilities towards the environment and carry on with mindless consumption of resources.</p>
<p>On “<strong>World Environment Day</strong>”, let us take a quick look at environmental responsibilities of the corporate citizen.  Businesses consume a large amount of energy, natural resources and produce hundreds of tons of waste every year.  And yet, until recently, most businesses have paid no attention to their responsibility towards protecting and preserving the environment.</p>
<p>Thankfully, things are changing for the good.  Today, environmental responsibility is not something that businesses have to practice due to regulatory burden.  As the cost of energy, water, and other resources soar high; businesses are looking for greener sources that are environment-friendly and cost-effective as well.  And the process of making businesses green has already begun.</p>
<p>Today, there are many products and services available on the market that can aid businesses in their environment-friendly goals.  For example – we have already talked about <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/how-will-tesla-energy-aid-the-call-center-industry.html">Tesla energy</a> solutions that use solar power to generate sufficient energy to run a business. There are more such solutions that use inexhaustible resources to produce cleaner energy. Using these in a business will surely help a business go green, reduce their dependency on energy companies and reduce their operational cost in this process. It will also preserve exhaustible resources, such as-coal and crude oil.</p>
<p>Of course, not all businesses will be able to access such technology.  But even if that’s the case, they can do their bit towards protection of our environment.  It is the little changes that can make a big impact.</p>
<p>First of all, businesses can adhere to reducing, reusing and recycling. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A business uses thousands of paper cups every year. Only North America <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/84187/hey_coffee_drinker,_ditch_that_paper_cup" target="_blank">consumes</a> 50 million trees a year for paper cups. So, by replacing paper cups with reusable ceramic mugs, a company can save a few thousands every year. It also allows them to take a step towards fulfilling their environmental responsibility by reducing waste and taking a stand against chopping down trees. You can also encourage employees to bring their mug to promote personalization and individuality.</li>
<li>Digitizing files, documents, and reports is also an environment-friendly practice. There is no need to print a copy unless it is necessary. This way, a business can save money on stationery, get organized, save space and save some trees. If it is necessary to use papers, a business can also opt for recycled papers. Fusion believes in a paperless office and case printing a copy is unavoidable, the company always opts for recycled papers.</li>
<li>A business can save power by switching off the lights and PCs when not in use, using the heating or cooling systems responsibly. An energy audit can promote further energy saving and optimum running of the machines. At Fusion, we are meticulous about unnecessary energy consumption and we take pride in our efficient use of energy.</li>
<li>Reusing files, pens, tape dispensers and other stationery items will also help a business reduce waste and cut the cost. As Fusion says – waste not, want not.</li>
<li>Recycling items such as old electronics, appliances, etc. can also be a good idea. Some manufacturers recycle their old hardware free of charge.  All you have to do is to contact them.</li>
<li>Businesses can also run awareness campaigns to educate their employees about going green. Involving them in your green initiative by participating in a community gardening or community clean up event will also foster a sense of belonging.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these steps will not have its effect on the environment overnight, they will surely have a positive impact in the long run.</p>
<p>On “World Environment Day 2015”, Fusion wholeheartedly supports this year’s theme of “Consume with Care.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the devastating earthquake in Nepal and north India, we kept asking ourselves one question &#8211; <em>how can we minimize the effects of a natural disaster on a business</em>? We are sure that business owners from around the world often consider the same.</p>
<p>Industrious as we are, we often find ourselves helpless during natural disasters, be it an earthquake, hurricane or heavy snowfall. In situations like these, businesses have to ensure the safety of its employees, maintaining a smooth operation and responding to its customers in the hour of need. And for this, businesses need a rock solid backup plan that will help them mitigate losses and keep running the operations as seamlessly as possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a large percentage of businesses fail to plan for natural disasters and emergencies. It leaves them susceptible to heavy losses that could have been avoided.</p>
<p>As most disasters come unannounced, it is better to prepare beforehand. At Fusion, we follow a defined plan to prevent any losses due to natural disasters.  All you need is a few important tactics. Some of them are:</p>
<p><strong>Set a Protocol:</strong> Make sure your employees know exactly what is expected from them when an emergency, natural or man-made occurs. Creating a checklist to eliminate confusion or uncertainty can be a good idea.</p>
<p>Fusion believes in training its employees on disaster management and recovery and ensures that they adhere to the plan in case of a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Make a Continuity Plan:</strong> Identify routine activities that are critical to the business and evaluate whether they can continue during a disaster.</p>
<p>Fusion evaluates each emergency situation and decides on the viability of running the mission-critical activities.</p>
<p><strong>Get Backup Contacts:</strong> Make sure you have a comprehensive staff contact list, including home and cell phone numbers, emergency contact information, personal email addresses, and home addresses.</p>
<p>From our experience, we have known this list to be very useful during emergencies.</p>
<p><strong>Use the Cloud:</strong> Regularly backup key documents and data in a secure virtual environment.</p>
<p>Fusion has two data centers in India and the United States where we backup data and documents regularly and use each as the other’s backup.</p>
<p><strong>Go Remote:</strong> Establish and offer a system for your employees to work remotely from home. Thanks to cloud-based virtual private networks (VPNs) working remotely from home has become quite easy.</p>
<p>We have a large number of home-based agents in the United States who can be immensely helpful in case of a localized disaster. In case of a national emergency in the United States, we can depend on our centers in Canada, India, the Philippines, and <a href="http://www.ocurrance.com/spanish-call-center.html" target="_blank">El Salvador</a>.</p>
<p>Your customers may need you the most during such emergencies (for example- insurance claims), you can always consider outsourcing your customer services, inquiry handling, claim processing services to a reputable call center. In fact, partnering with a call center can be beneficial for your business on many levels.</p>
<p>No one wants to fall victim to a disaster situation, natural or otherwise. However it serves us all well to stay prepared for such cases.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a customer calls the contact center of a business and communicates with its agents, they should always have a pleasant customer experience. However, in many cases, the customers have an experience that is far from pleasant. More often than not, it is because of the disengaged agents who do not put their 100% in the job.</p>
<p>Yes, a lack of engagement is one of the biggest challenges businesses are facing nowadays. As a matter of fact, the U.S. economy loses $350 billion annually due to these disengaged employees. The loss is not only in terms of productivity, but it is also the main cause of employee attrition. Research shows that the engaged employees are <a href="http://www.bunchball.com/resources/its-no-game-gamification-transforming-call-center">87%</a> less likely to part ways with an organization than the disengaged.</p>
<p>So, the question remains – is there a magic solution that can elevate the customer experience, improve business operations and transform the disengaged employees into loyal brand advocates?</p>
<p>Um, yes. And it is known as gamification. When applied in the right context, it can yield multiple benefits to a business. The benefits include:</p>
<p><strong>It Allows Business to Collect Powerful Customer Data</strong> &#8211; Businesses can learn loads of new information about their customers using gamification techniques. This allows them to engage the customers in a personalized conversation and improves the customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>Gamification Can Also be a Good Learning Tool – </strong>Using the gamification creatively, a business can launch a new product or service in the market. Even the simple technique of introducing the customers who visit their site to the product and teaching them about its use via a game allows a business to earn new businesses.</p>
<p>However, business should have a clear idea about how much they want to offer to the prospects. Giving it all out for free is never a good business technique.</p>
<p><strong>Gamification Can Help Business Reengage their Employees</strong> &#8211; Taking the cue from gamification techniques; a business can also engage their employees to give their very best at work. Introducing titles like employee of the week/ month/ year, announcing reward points and prizes will keep the employees engaged.</p>
<p>In a contact center, that will mean more satisfied customers, more sales, and a stable workforce. Some major employee issues like loss of productivity and employee attrition can be avoided.</p>
<p>Take a look at these five amazing statistics on the use of gamification.</p>
<ol>
<li>According to Gartner, by 2016, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/user/registration/prospect?resId=2226015&amp;srcId=1-3132930191&amp;pcp=gi_sr_gam&amp;cm_sp=gi-_-free-_-heroleft" target="_blank">gamification will become an essential element</a> for businesses to improve customer marketing and loyalty.</li>
<li>By 2015, the gamification industry is estimated to grow to more than <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gabe-zichermann/gamification_b_2516376.html?ir=India" target="_blank">$2 billion</a> in the U.S. according to M2 Research.</li>
<li>According to <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2211115" target="_blank">Gartner</a>, over 40% of the top-notch companies will be using gamification to give their business operations a complete makeover by the end of 2015,</li>
<li>According to a report by <a href="https://www.custedge.com/gamification-get-your-contact-centre-game-on/" target="_blank">Aberdeen Research</a>, businesses that used gamification have experienced two times faster growth in their annual revenue than their peers.</li>
<li>In a research by <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/05/18/the-future-of-gamification/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a>, 53% of participants predicted that by the year 2020, gamification will spread far and wide among businesses, while 42% respondents have also predicted that, by 2020, gamification will not become a larger trend except in specific cases.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One month into 2015 and the call center industry is already undergoing a drastic change. Many call centers have implemented new policies and procedures to maximize their performance in the future.</p>
<p>The focus of these changes includes &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving customer satisfaction</li>
<li>Increasing agent productivity</li>
<li>Reducing overhead</li>
</ul>
<p>So what’s new in 2015?</p>
<p>This year there is increased emphasis on call center technologies that help businesses meet the needs and preferences of the customers. There are quite a few things changing in the call center domain with these goals in mind. Want to know more about these changes?</p>
<p>Follow these cool call center trends of 2015.</p>
<h3>Call centers are now offering self-service systems along with agent support</h3>
<p>The new age customers are far more tech-savvy than their predecessors. A large section of these customers prefers self-service over waiting in a queue to get an assisted customer support. In fact, automated service has become the in thing as it helps customers in resolving common queries.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-service also bodes well for the call centers too. With <a href="https://fonolo.com/blog/2013/04/should-your-call-center-be-using-self-service/">self-service</a> in the place agents no longer have to provide solutions to easy-to-fix issues and as a result they can dedicate their time to complex queries and disgruntled callers.</p>
<p>Also, due to self-service facility the call queue shortens considerably leading to quicker resolution of the problems. Thus, self-service can improve customer satisfaction as well as agent productivity. This way, self service offers a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/changing-scenario-customer-support-channels-2015-kishore-saraogi">win-win situation for the call center and the customer</a>.</p>
<h3>Call centers are going Multichannel to reach customers across different communication platforms<strong>.</strong></h3>
<p>Call centers today do not stick to just phone calls to interact with the callers. Today there are more communication channels such as chats, video calls, mobile apps and social media have become powerful mediums to communicate with the customer and to resolve their issues.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/collaboration/unified-communications/net_business_benefit0900aecd8073dd1e.html">Multi-channel communication</a> offers callers the freedom of using any communication platform. A large number of callers today do not like waiting in queues to talk to an agent. So they prefer chat or any other ways to reach a call center. In most cases, they choose their preferred medium based on their location and convenience.</p>
<p>This in turn reduces complaints and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/can-contact-centers-eliminate-call-holding-time.html">increases customer satisfaction</a> and agent efficiency.</p>
<h3>Better use of cloud storage.</h3>
<p>In this era of cutting edge technology, information sharing, and storage has become all the easier, thanks to cloud storage.  It is not only convenient for the customers but also for the call center as well.</p>
<p>Cloud storage lowers their overhead by eradicating the need for large IT departments and servers that need huge space and a constant supply of electricity.</p>
<p>Cloud storage is especially beneficial for a multi-location call center and virtual call center.  Apart from that <a href="http://www.vocalcom.com/en/contact-center-software/the-growing-adoption-of-cloud-storage-over-data-centers-316640/">cloud storage</a> can also offer data safety in case of any disaster.</p>
<h3>Superior identification and verification processes</h3>
<p>Even today, a typical identification and verification process takes a large chunk of call time – now that is a very long procedure.  To reduce this time businesses are streamlining their call centers and equipping the verification process using improved technology.</p>
<p>This year, call centers are using biometric technology to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gartnergroup/2014/06/18/preventing-fraud-in-the-call-center-with-phone-printing-and-voice-biometrics/">identify customers</a>.  A customer can use the fingerprint scanner on mobile app and voice identification on phone calls for identifying themselves.</p>
<p>This will ensure the security of customer data and at the same time allow companies more time to resolve customers’ inquiries.</p>
<h3>More dependence on real-time metrics and agent reports</h3>
<p>The customers today are more demanding. On one hand they demand quick resolution of their problems on the other they long for personalized service.  The business who can strike a balance between the both ultimately wins the customers over.</p>
<p>Thankfully, today it is a lot easier to find out a customer’s likes, dislikes, relationships, and habits.  So, an advanced metrics can be created and used in every sphere.</p>
<p>By incorporating the advanced <a href="http://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/searchCRM/downloads/metrics-PDF_revised.pdf">metrics</a> into a call center, a business can enjoy greater insight into their clients.  Using the real-time analytics call centers can direct a particular call to the agents who can handle them.</p>
<p>This will ensure proper utilization of agent’s skills which will lead to better agent productivity and improved caller satisfaction. Using advanced metrics it is also possible to point out the weakness of an agent. This will also allow the company to re-train this agent on that specific part.</p>
<p>Implementing these practices into daily call center practice can prepare a call center for the next generation of tech-savvy customers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new year marks new beginning. Every year, people from across the world make some spirited resolutions on New Year. So, last week we asked our agents what they want to achieve this New Year and got a huge response from them.</p>
<p>When we looked closely, we found that despite different answers there are some popular resolutions for most of them.</p>
<p>Here are the 5 most popular resolutions that our agents have made for 2015:-</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Learn New Skills to Improve Efficiency</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone wants to improve themselves and if their goal of self-improving has a positive impact on their profession – it brings them more joy. For this reason, a large section of our agents has chosen learning a new skill as their priority in their new year’s resolution.</p>
<p>Now did they have the same skill set in mind? Well, no.  Some wanted to get better organized, some wanted to work on their MS-Excel skills, and some wanted to learn a new language altogether. But all these resolutions had a common purpose – to aid them in their professional field as well as their personal lives.</p>
<p>Fusion is always ready to help its agents. We have different training sessions in which we train our agents on subjects like – time management, organization, corporate communication, etc. Our department heads are always willing to help young talents <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/fusions-take-on-employee-welfare-in-bpo.html" target="_blank">learn new skills</a> that will help them advance in their career.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Become a Better Team Player</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Together each achieve more – what can be a better definition of a team? In a team, everyone has got each other’s back. They help each other in tough issues, keep each other company in tense situations and together find ways to emerge from it.</p>
<p>A call center team is no exception.  Each agent helps their peers to deliver their best service to their clients. However, new agents often find it a little tough to adjust with the rest of the team.  At that time, it is the responsibility of the team to accommodate the new agents and make them feel at home. If they can do it, they will become a better team and good team players.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we often do some team building exercises to strengthen the bond between each team member. We strongly recommend that a team should also go for small outings and dinners. After all, a team that eats together stays together.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>Treat Each Caller with Empathy to Make them Feel Comfortable</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the age of state-of-the -art customer service, every customer wants to be pampered by call center agents every time they call the customer care.  And it is the agent’s responsibility to make each customer feel special with prompt service, first call issue resolution, and cordial behavior.  But is that enough?</p>
<p>In this age of multichannel connectivity, customers have become a fan of personalized attention.   To meet their demands, every call center agent first needs to understand their situation and then deliver a solution depending on the issue.  Therefore, they need to treat every customer with empathy. It will allow them to give each customer the personalized attention they require.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we always train the agents to <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/10-ways-customer-service-rep-grow-customer-empathy.html" target="_blank">treat every customer with empathy</a>. In case some agents feel that they are not being able to fully empathize with the customers, they can always opt for one of these trainings anytime.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Pay Attention to Fitness</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now this one needs no introduction.  It is on everyone’s New Year resolution list for 2015 (and pretty much for every year).  A fit body and healthy mind is a prerequisite of every aspect of one’s life &#8211; be it professional or personal.</p>
<p>However, maintaining the fitness can be quite challenging a task for the call center agents who work night shifts or graveyard shifts. Therefore, fitness has always been a matter of concern for call center agents. However, if they maintain a balance in their lives by taking adequate shut-eye, eating good diet and exercising, they can work their way towards their desired fitness level.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we take the health of each agent very seriously.  Besides setting up regular medical camps at the office, we also offer them <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/fusion-shares-5-great-habits-to-match-the-lifestyle-of-a-bpo-job.html" target="_blank">tips to maintain a healthy lifestyle</a>.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3>Climb the Corporate Ladder by Cracking the Next IJP</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A large section of the call center workforce is young people. They have this burning desire to prove their worth and climb the corporate ladder. And the best way of moving up in the organization is through internal job posting.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we love ambition, and we wholeheartedly support an agent who wants to move up the corporate ladder.  An agent can opt for our ongoing training sessions to harness their skills and at the same time ask their seniors for advice. And when they get selected in the internal job posting (IJP), we are as happy as they are for their success.</p>
<p>After all these, you must be wondering about our New Year resolution.  Simple, our resolution is to deliver state of the art <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/2014-customer-service-week-6-ways-to-make-deliver-the-best-customer-service.html" target="_blank">customer service</a> throughout the year.</p>
<p>And with that note Fusion wants to wish each of you a Happy and Prosperous New Year 2015!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are those days when businesses in the United States used to pay no attention to the Latino community. Nowadays, they are the apple of every businessman’s eyes. And why not? This third largest ethnic group in the United States boasts a <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/engaging-the-evolving-hispanic-consumers.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$1.4 trillion</a> purchasing capacity. Now, that is a market that every business wants to enter.</p>
<p>Now, before concentrating on how businesses can win the Latino people over with, take a quick look at why businesses have ignored them so far? A few years back, it was thought that the Latino people are too loyal to change their brands and that they are not interested in luxury products.</p>
<p>However, the recent years have proven things otherwise. Today, thanks to the rise in purchasing capacity, the Hispanics are willing to experiment with brands and luxury products. Hence, more and more businesses are getting increasingly interested in conquering this marketplace.</p>
<p>However, entering this market has not been as easy for the businesses as entering other markets. There are some tight spots that businesses have to come out of first. And in order to do so, they will have to know what those tight spots are.</p>
<p>Dealing with Latino community, businesses often face language issues. As most Latino people use Spanish as their first language, businesses have to do their promotions all over again in order to approach the Hispanic audience.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Latino people have a very different culture than the US. So, in order to make them buy a product, businesses have to adapt to their culture and convince them that the products or services they are offering are in perfect harmony with the Latino culture.</p>
<p>While both of these were very tough challenges for the businesses, they came up with some exciting solutions for these challenges.</p>
<h3><strong>Challenge 1: Language Issues</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>  As most people of the Latino community chiefly speaks Spanish, the promotions and customer communications has to be in Spanish.</p>
<p>For promotions, everything from print, radio and TV ads to infomercials has to be in Spanish, so that it reaches the highest number of audience.</p>
<p>As for customer service, Spanish should be the prime mode of conversation. For this, businesses can have an in-house Spanish contact center or <a href="http://www.ocurrance.com/spanish-call-center.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hire a Spanish call center service from Central America</a>. While in-house contact center can be a pricey option for businesses, hiring one is an economic solution. It also allows businesses to render world class service to their customers.</p>
<h3><strong>Challenge 2: Cultural Issues</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> In order to deal with the cultural issues, companies have to introduce Latino culture in their marketing and promotional activities. For example – they can offer a discount during Latino festivals; <a href="http://www.ordersatellitenow.com/blog/dishlatino-launches-its-first-ever-cross-border-promotion.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hire a Latino celebrity</a> for the promotional activities for the businesses. It will help them come closer to the Latino community, which eventually adds to their benefit.</p>
<p>Apart from these two major issues, there are some other issues a business has to keep in mind while entering the Latino marketplace.</p>
<p>Just changing promotional and customer relation strategies are not going to be enough to stay in the Latino marketplace. For that, businesses need to make some changes in their management structures as well. They must have a member of Latino community in the top management in order to oversee the best interests of the Latino consumers.</p>
<p>Having a Latino brand ambassador can also be a good strategy on behalf of the management.</p>
<p>However, in order to fit into the Latino marketplace, a company must not give up its long term goals.  In fact, it should make the changes necessary while keeping its long term goal in mind. A lot of businesses have opted for this strategy in the Latino marketplace and has become immensely successful.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Customer service week is here again – a time for the companies and customer service providers to reflect on their customer service standards and scopes of improvement in that field.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.csweek.com/customer_service_week.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Customer Service Week</a> is an international event devoted to recognizing the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html" target="_blank">importance of customer service</a> and to honoring the people who serve and support customers with the highest degree of care and professionalism.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we celebrate this week by &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Boosting morale, motivation and teamwork.</li>
<li>Rewarding our frontline reps.</li>
<li>Raising awareness of the importance of customer service.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, reminding our customers of our commitment to customer satisfaction.  Being a well known third party customer service provider it is our job to keep our clients’ customers satisfied and we leave no stone unturned to attain that goal.</p>
<p>At Fusion we believe that Customer Service week is not just an event where we recognize customer service best practices, it is an event that inspires us to deliver our best in the field of customer service throughout the year. And to do so, we have a 6-pointer strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforcing the Customer Service Standard of Our Clients on a Daily Basis: </strong></p>
<p>We adhere to our clients’ customer service standards so that their customers enjoy an optimum customer experience every single time. And in order to stick to that high standard we conduct a brief meeting before hitting the floor and remind our employees of the importance of quality customer service.<br />
<strong>Review and Revamp (If Necessary) Our Customer Service Staff</strong></p>
<p>From time to time we carefully evaluate our hiring and selection procedure. We look for certain qualities in our customer service employees. These are</p>
<ul>
<li>Warmth – Human kindness</li>
<li>Empathy – Understanding what the customer is feeling</li>
<li>Teamwork – a team player</li>
<li>Optimism – the ability to quickly recover from any setback and take up any challenge in a positive note</li>
<li>Diligence – the capability and willingness to be with a customer from the beginning to the end</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Working with Technical Skills</strong></p>
<p>We aim to quickly provide the right solution to every customer. We believe that, you should provide a first call solution to every customer. There is no point in being nice to customer every time they call while not being of any service at all. It will eventually turn off a customer. We are always looking for new ways to strengthen the technical parts of customer service to deliver efficient, effective and timely solutions to the customers.</p>
<p><strong>Working with a Smile</strong></p>
<p>We are also a firm believer of delivering quality service with a smile. While delivering quick and efficient service, it is possible that some of the employees forget to offer a customer the warmth and kindness which they look for. We ensure that this does not happen. At the end of the call, a customer should have a lingering smile in their face.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering Employees</strong></p>
<p>We believe in empowering the employee. We encourage them to do the right thing. This way, our front-line employees can offer the customers the solution in the quickest possible time and defuse any complaint before it gets online and spreads like a wildfire.</p>
<p><strong>Define the Standard to each Frontline Employee</strong></p>
<p>Each of our frontline employees knows the customer service standard our clients adhere to. They also know the reason behind those standards and enjoy autonomy in how they will adhere to the standard in the frontline.</p>
