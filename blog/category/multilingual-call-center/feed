								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b><i>¡hola! | </i></b><b><i>Hej! | </i></b><b><i>Ciao! | </i></b><b><i>Bonjour! | </i></b><b><i>Aloha!</i></b></p>
<p>These are the simple lingos for saying “<em>HELLO</em>” in Spanish, Swedish, Italian, French, and Hawaiian respectively.</p>
<p>In what language does your customer speak? Are you able to give them a multilingual support? What you choose to help customer get your service in their native tongue? – Outsourcing or in sourcing?</p>
<p>Preferable pick at present is Outsourcing, but why all businesses choose it? Does it provide a competitive edge to your business?</p>
<h3>Rising Demand of Multilingual Call Centers</h3>
<p>Global population indicator shows that the countries today have a mixed-culture everywhere. Mixed-culture doth bring in people, speaking in more than one language within a small area.</p>
<p>We know that the target market for different products and services keeps on changing so as the people and their native tongue. Your business needs to expand with multi-country clients where call volumes in some languages are very low.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is impossible for companies to maintain an in-house multilingual customer service as it demands trained staff and expensive equipments. Thus, companies prefer to outsource.</p>
<p>What can a multilingual outsourcing provider do? &#8211; Multilingual call center outsourcing of today helps businesses to reach out to the national markets with the use of agents speaking in the native tongue.</p>
<h3>Multilingual Service @Fusion BPO</h3>
<p>Speaking of multilingual call centers, at Fusion BPO, multilingual support is a familiar call center jargon. We have been providing clientele <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/multilingual-call-center.html" target="_blank">support in multiple languages</a> in order to meet different business needs. We have been tailoring flexible solution to our client’s multilingual needs whether they ask for one-off marketing campaigns or want a fully outsourced customer support.</p>
<p>How is it possible for Fusion to maintain this thread of <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/can-contact-centers-eliminate-call-holding-time.html" target="_blank">multi-channel</a> call center communication for such a long time? Handling multilingual call is simple, but Fusionites focuses on five important trends that helps global call centers to gain an edge over the competitors.</p>
<p>Let us get into the discussion.</p>
<h3>Trend 1: Appointing Specialists to Handle the Multilingual Calls</h3>
<p>Clients who outsource their business want to view a perfect gradient in their profit summary at the end of every month. Handling bilingual or multilingual calls was beyond their reach, which made them reach us.</p>
<p><strong>How do we help businesses?</strong></p>
<p>&#8211;  To meet the desired client satisfaction level we appoint specialists trained in multiple languages. This is our core competency that gives us the ability to manage customers efficiently despite the language barrier.</p>
<h3>Trend 2: Keeping an Eye on the Call Quality</h3>
<p>Simply reaching out to the customers speaking in their native tongue is not going to bring business.</p>
<p><strong>How do we help businesses?</strong></p>
<p>&#8211;   As a multilingual call center, we keep a strict eye on the call quality. We use quality systems to monitor our agent’s performance and measure the leads in a fixed interval. We make sure that the agents keep on feeding what they learn during their ongoing training or coaching.</p>
<h3>Trend 3: Flexible Call Pricing</h3>
<p>Cost reduction is the foremost reasons that make businesses outsource their work. Multilingual call centers are not exception.</p>
<p>To maintain an in-house call center B2B marketers have to invest huge capital to install equipments, phone-lines, technology such as voice, e-mail, web handling, CRM and have to manage recruitment &amp; training across multiple languages.</p>
<p><strong>How do we help businesses?</strong></p>
<p>&#8211;  B2B marketers outsource their campaigns at global BPOs like Fusion as they do it at half the price compared to an in-house call center. Our clients can feel the best value for money against their campaigns outsourced to us.</p>
<h3>Trend 4: Can Reach Target Market Faster Than In-House Teams</h3>
<p>We live in a fast moving world. Most of the International brands with whom Fusion works want to reach their target market at a faster pace. As the market faces stiff competition every day, B2B and B2C business owners want to stay one-step ahead of their opponents.</p>
<p><strong>How do we help businesses?</strong></p>
<p>&#8211;  Being a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/speak-global-motto-of-outsourcing-contact-centers.html" target="_blank">reliable multilingual call center</a>, Fusion trains their agents and initiates the service within few weeks. We have enough resource and technological advancements to support our client&#8217;s niche at any occasion.</p>
<h3>Trend 5: Flexible Services to B2B and B2C Client in Peak Seasons</h3>
<p>Often our B2B or B2C partners make queries on the flexibility of outsourced services that can help them to handle seasonal peaks efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>How do we help businesses?</strong></p>
<p>&#8211;  Fusionites have the capability to handle multiple products in multiple languages (often from different clients) at short notice during unexpected peaks. We retain the ongoing product training, besides running the campaign and keeping aside a pool of talent as backup for seasonal peaks.</p>
<p>These five trends are some of the evaluation criteria that a global multilingual call center must preserve when clients choose them as outsourcing partners. Fusionites are no exception. We stand prominent among other because &#8211; <i>Of the little change we have brought in the way we work, think about things that are of second nature to others and learn as the campaigns moves along.</i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The contemporary business concerns safely count on call center companies in Manila in order to provide them with impeccable database services. It is the <strong>Manila BPO</strong> representatives who are entrusted with the task of procuring data from various arenas and maintaining them very methodically.</p>
<p>A valid database is very important for the entrepreneurs and the management executives. Even the marketing executives rely a lot on the database in order to plan and execute the most rewarding marketing campaigns. Without an idea of the actual requirements of the consumers, without knowing whether or not the consumers are in a financial condition to afford the business products and services, launching a promotional campaign makes no sense. Such a hasty action would lead to total wastage of valuable business resources.</p>
<p>Procuring data and adding to the database is an ongoing process. Even after the business marketing campaigns have been planned, the business cannot afford to stop in the process of data collection. Data needs to be collected in order to see how the newly launched products and services are being received. At the same time, it is equally important to document the incoming calls. It is through these calls businesses can figure out how well the consumer market have accepted their products and services.</p>
<p>When a <strong><a title="BPO Manila" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/philippines.html">BPO Manila</a></strong> is appointed for database maintenance, businesses can rest assured that they will be provided with flawless transcription service and an up- to- date database. Formulating business policies become easier when the decision making authorities have exposure to such concrete databases.</p>

Given the complications in the prevailing market scenario and also keeping in mind the global nature of the market economy, it is necessary that the business qualified lead generation campaigns targets a multinational, multiethnic- in short a global customer base.</p>
<p>The first and foremost requirement the businesses have to rope in the maximum numbers of international customers is to be able to connect with the latter. And if a connection has to established between the business and the probable buyers it is essential that the business marketing agents knows the language of the target audience. Here in the problem arises.</p>
<p>Imagine a US based business enterprise; it is natural that the business marketing agents are proficient in English language. But the very fact that the business enterprises looks forward to acquiring a global customer base, marketing agents proficient in the English language alone is not going to suffice. It is for the sake of the business growth and development that the marketing agents need to have knowledge of multiple languages which include English, Spanish, French and others. And this is where the <strong><a title="multilingual call centers" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/">multilingual call centers</a></strong> have become so crucial.</p>
<p>From the finance point of view and also as prompted by the prevailing market conditions the cost cutting motives does not permit the business to hire and maintain in-house agents who are proficient in multiple languages. It is for the improvement of the business sales performance and to brighten the growth prospects that multilingual call center companies have become so crucial.</p>

Don’t you think it gets a little difficult for the marketing personnel to reach out to a multi ethnic, multi national client base that your business aims for? Is it really possible for you to hire separate marketing agents to reach out to different sections of your target audience?</p>
<p>Well all the above questions have only one answer and that would be telemarketing outsourcing. But delegating the responsibility of conducting telemarketing campaigns to a third party for your business is not anything new. This has been the practice for quite a few decades now. What is new is that now the business enterprises need to look for multilingual call center companies so that they can reach out to their targeted multi language speaking target audience.</p>
<p>Wondering why the marketing agents need to speak different languages, isn’t English good enough. Well no. If the knowledge of English would have sufficed then no call center company would have bothered to take the extra initiative to recruit new agents with a sound knowledge of the key international languages nor they would have organized for language classes to train the existing staffs.</p>
<p>The world’s most active commercial and economic hubs are located in USA, UK, South East Asia and parts of Europe- these locations have a cosmopolitan population base most of whom do not converse to be correct does not understand English. The business marketing campaigns to make sense to these sections of the population has to be conducted in the target’s native language. This is where the present day telemarketing firms with a <strong><a title="multilingual call center" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/multilingual-call-center.html">multilingual call center</a></strong> employee base come to the rescue.</p>
