								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>B2B telemarketing is one of the toughest methods that we carry in our call centers. Our marketing team does all the hard work to nurture a lead successfully and turn it into a potential prospect. Fusion is a telemarketing expert, and their agents nurture quality leads for every project they handle. However, it was not the same all the time.</p>
<p>In the beginning of our marketing campaigns even after attending 900 calls, we hardly used to gain 10 to 15 leads. Agents do feel disappointed, and our marketing team went about finding the flaws in the process.</p>
<p>So, what we did to correct our lead generation process? We made our agent receive both formal and informal training. We organized three basic rules for handling the telemarketing calls effectively. Believe us we saw an 839% improvement in our leads, as our agents started to meet 8 leads after 550 calls.</p>
<p>What were the three tactics that brought Fusion such a vast change in their telemarketing approach?</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Being Human</i></li>
<li><i>Building A Relationship</i></li>
<li><i>Be Knowledgeable</i></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, the three blanket statements, which were once hard to apply, are now our strength. We have learned in the due course that translation must start with the person who makes the call, because warming up of leads start with one-on-one telephonic conversation.</p>
<h3>Being Human</h3>
<p>Customers like to buy thing from people and not from the companies. When our agents began selling product and service for a company, the agent&#8217;s convincing power takes the customer into confidence.</p>
<p>An agent helps to make the customer rely on the products. For that, they make sure that they concentrate on each call, focus on the decision makers, etc. We know that telemarketing is a highly stressful process, but we can prevent the errors just assigning proper energy to each call.</p>
<p>Along with the focus, one needs to start fresh with every call. Agents should sound as if they are attending the call for the first time. The flaw and the mistakes of the previous call need to be left behind and one must start afresh to qualify the next sales lead.</p>
<p>To optimize the approach of the call, at Fusion we follow some rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>We take notes on the call and call style</li>
<li>Assess the call quality and get feedback from the mentors and the managers</li>
<li>Accelerates constructive criticism</li>
</ul>
<h3>Building a Relationship</h3>
<p>According to <em>Marketing Powers</em>, the conversation is between two humans in a telemarketing process, we have to focus on the <a href="http://www.marketingpower.com/ResourceLibrary/Documents/newsletters/b2b/2012/10/a-lead-is-a-lead-creating-universal-lead-definition.pdf" target="_blank">universal lead definition</a>. One of the most important aspects of universal lead definition is to ask open-ended questions. This initiates less questioning and better flow during the conversation. Even a decision maker gets a chance to provide complete information about the company&#8217;s issues and solutions.</p>
<p>We come across another aspect called the <a href="http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/robert.shumsky/xtrain_large_cc.pdf" target="_blank">80/20 rule</a>, which helps us to listen 80% and talk 20% in a particular call. This not only gives our agents the time to configure notes but also provides them with adequate information.</p>
<h3>Be Knowledgeable</h3>
<p>Good habits help to make the call better. This includes abilities like building a good relationship with our customers, starting every call fresh, never get out of focus from the goal of the call. We avoid using those practices that are crutch like &#8211; <i>scheduling the call back time or sending an email or keeping the customers on hold for a longer time.</i></p>
<p>Another way we make our agents knowledgeable is making them familiar with the product and service. Fusion makes their agent aware of the company&#8217;s value proposition to show the benefits, which a customer can gain.</p>
<p>Whatever tactics you might be using in the call center to make the telemarketing campaigns 100% successful, you cannot ignore the most essential aspect &#8211; <em><b>you have to keep the process simple</b></em>. Since, clarity always trumps persuasion.</p>

Nearly half of the US business enterprises outsource to Indian call centers. And it is particularly the <strong><a title="telemarketing in India" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/">telemarketing in India</a></strong> that has flourished like anything.</p>
<p>Given the efficiency and the inexpensiveness of the service, the responsibility of telemarketing can be blindly entrusted on any Indian call centers. And your company can experience rapid growth from such telemarketing endeavors put in by an eminent call center service provider.</p>
<p>Besides being the champions in telemarketing, Indian call centers are beneficial form other aspects too:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2666.png" alt="♦" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Money is a factor. Because labor in India is pretty cheap when compared to the US labor rates, this brings down the overall operational costs substantially.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2666.png" alt="♦" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The fluency in speaking English and the clear accent of the Indian population also adds to the appeal of the call centers in the region.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2666.png" alt="♦" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Next is the time zone in which India belongs. The time difference with US is of exact 12 hours. This turns out to be really convenient in conducting the telemarketing campaigns. Also telemarketing in India is conducted in two- or three shift operations only to ensure that such campaign runs 24/7.</p>

When outbound call centers strategically plan telemarketing outsourcing services, they must use their common sense generously as that alone will stand the businesses in good stead and enable them and will also help the marketing endeavors of telemarketing in India cal centers succeed to a great extent.</p>
<p>Common sense must be applied by the telemarketing outsourcing call centers for finding out if the market is viable before the products and services of businesses can be launched. The telemarketing in India services must also chalk out the action that the businesses expect customers to take before implementation of the marketing tactics and strategies.</p>
<p>Telemarketing in India call centers must also maintain a budget for time that is spent on marketing tools and activities. It is also a good idea to increase the prices if the costs have increased. It will make sense for the telemarketing call centers to find out the strengths as well as weaknesses of their client’s competitors; this way the <strong><a title="telemarketing in india" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/">telemarketing in India</a></strong> call center agents will be able to best capitalize on the weaknesses of competitors and defend against the strengths of the rival companies.</p>
<p>Telemarketing also requires the agents to have a plan ready so that they know what to achieve, how to achieve and also know the deadline to achieve it. When marketing products and services, it is unwise for businesses to think that they know all about the attitudes and behaviors of customers, as these are customer attributes that can change with time.</p>
