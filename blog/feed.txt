<p>Great customer service is the need of the hour. If as an
organization you cannot provide good customer service you are sure to lose
their loyalty at some point in time. Therefore, you need to provide the best
possible service to your customer.</p>



<p>While every business today tries to <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html">provide excellent customer service</a> and reduce the customer effort with timely and effective support to improve their experience, it fails to recognize the most important aspect of delivering a customer experience – their employees who serve in a customer facing role. </p>



<p>If you make it difficult or the employees to do their job,
it will translate to the experience they deliver to your customers.&nbsp; Even if the difficult task is not directly
related to the customer, the frustration of doing that task somehow impacts the
employee-customer interaction. Also, it gradually makes your employees <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/reasons-and-remedies-of-employee-disengagement.html">disengaged</a>
resulting in an even poorer customer experience. Yet according to a CCW 2019 <a href="https://www.customercontactweekdigital.com/content-auto-download/5be9b822d1d92e406f3b64d1">study</a>,
most companies do not pay as much attention to reducing employee effort as they
do to personalization. </p>



<p>At Fusion, we give our employees utmost importance and
recognize their unique position in delivering a good customer experience. Therefore,
we always ask ourselves the following questions:</p>



<ul><li>What&#8217;s keeping employees from delivering the
great experience that your customers deserve?</li><li>Is there a way to simplify workflows and
processes?</li><li>How can we make it easier for employees to do their
job?</li><li>How do we make it easier for agents to deliver a
great customer experience by removing complexities, complications, and
bureaucracy?</li><li>Are there ways to reduce effort for employees
and ultimately, for customers?</li></ul>



<p>With our vast experience in the customer service industry,
we have found that making necessary changes to reduce the efforts of your employees
leads to improved customer experience. Here are a few suggestions on how to
turn things around for our employees, and eventually, for the customer.</p>



<h3>1. Walk In Your Employees&#8217; Shoes</h3>



<p>Walking in your employees’ shoes in the best way to
understand the effort they put every day. To do this, you can create any of the
two following things: </p>



<ol><li>Employee journey maps</li><li>Your own undercover executive program, in which executives take on the role of the employee. </li></ol>



<p>Once you understand the effort, you&#8217;ll be able to unearth
the inefficiencies and ready to improve the process. At Fusion, we have used
undercover executive program to see whether the employees are finding it easy
to do their job.</p>



<h3>2. Pay Attention To What Your Employees Are Saying</h3>



<p>Listen to what your employees are telling you. Watch them
work. If they say a process is difficult or pointless, you need to look into it
and fix it the best way you can. Ignoring it is not a wise decision.</p>



<h3>3. Ensure Employees Have The Right Tools</h3>



<p>When you define employee roles and expectations, make sure
that your employees have the knowledge, skills, training, and resources
required to do the job. &nbsp;Without the
right tool, training and knowledge they will not be able to provide prompt and
to-the-point solution to your customers, resulting in a poor customer
experience. </p>



<h3>4. Reduce Their Effort With Modern Technology </h3>



<p>At Fusion, we believe in providing our employees with the
most modern tools that make their jobs easier and less time consuming. For
example – if customer service agents get <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">AI
assistance</a> that brings all the data related to a customer on a single
dashboard, it helps them serve the customer better. Having an <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/benefits-of-adopting-omnichannel-customer-support.html">omnichannel</a>
environment makes it easier for the agents to ask suggestions of other agents
without putting the customer on hold and thus it reduces the agent effort and
ultimately the customer effort as well.</p>



<h3>5. Define The Idea Of A Great Customer Experience </h3>



<p>Giving your employees a clear idea about your customers will
help them understand what needs to be done. Defining the idea of a great
customer experience to them will give them a clear target and help them
understand how to get there. </p>



<h3>6. Provide Ongoing Feedback</h3>



<p>Giving your employees regular feedback and ongoing coaching provides
them with the guidance they need to follow the right path, to do things in a
better manner and to do it right every single time. Just like employee feedback
helps create a better process, giving regular feedback and training to the
employees help them deliver a better customer experience. According to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/11-employee-feedback-statistics">Hubspot</a>,
regular employee feedback can greatly impact employee engagement.</p>



<p>These are some useful tips that can help you reduce agent effort, root out the inefficiencies, and create a streamlined and simpler work process that makes the job easier for the employees. A simpler work process with the right tools and technology result in a better customer service while regular feedback and timely training boosts employee engagement. As a result, your employees are happy and your customers are happier.</p>



<p>Fusion has always been an advocate of reducing employee efforts and engaging them with timely feedback and training. We feel that when our agents are engaged, they provide a far more efficient customer support that boosts customer satisfaction. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gamification is a fun and growing way that can improve collection call center performance and agent engagement. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">Gamification</a> has been very effective in improving employee performance and business results at collections-focused contact centers. Benefits of gamification programs include increased revenues from higher recovery rates, improved compliance, making training more fun and effective, and improved employee retention.</p>



<p>Employee engagement is a persistent problem of
collection-based call centers. Due to unengaged employees, collection call
centers often face an issue like: </p>



<ul><li>Flat or declining recovery rates</li><li>High abandon rates</li><li>Increased customer service complaints</li><li>Increased compliance violations</li><li>High employee attrition rates</li></ul>



<p>However, by adding gamification to the mix, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/collection-services.html">collection call centers</a> can improve script adherence, raising recovery rates, improving compliance with disclosure requirements, and reducing the onboard time for new agents by making training more effective. This change in agent behavior also helps collection centers to improve customer satisfaction ratings.</p>



<p>Having a long experience in the collection industry, Fusion
has a step-by-step approach in designing a gamification strategy to engage its
collection agents.&nbsp; </p>



<ol><li>Define goals</li><li>Apply interaction analytics to identify baseline
performance and improvement opportunities</li><li>Define key performance indicators (KPIs) for the
program</li><li>Identify the appropriate motivators for agents</li></ol>



<p>With our experience in this field, we understand that
successful gamification is not game oriented but goal oriented. Rooted in clear
business goals quantifiable by appropriate metrics, successful gamification
needs to have the right motivators so that agents can easily get hooked. Some
important things to remember while designing a gamification program:</p>



<h3>1. Define Goals</h3>



<p>A gamification program without a defined business goal is
doomed to fail from the beginning. If you don’t know what you want to achieve
through the program, running the program has no point at all. Whether you want
to improve customer satisfaction by 5%, reduce 10% employee attrition, or
improve your recovery rates, you need to be clear about that even before
designing a gamification program.</p>



<h3>2. Define KPI</h3>



<p>Having the right metrics is the key. You cannot judge
customer satisfaction by looking at script adherence rate. To make a
gamification program successful, you need appropriate metrics that help you
measure your success in terms of your business goals. You can use analytics to
keep a track of how things are going and whether there is any scope for
improvement.</p>



<h3>3. Choose Motivators</h3>



<p>Choosing motivators can be a difficult task as not everyone
is motivated by the same thing. While baby boomers get motivated to earn points
and rewards, millennials get motivated by public recognition. Therefore, it can
be easily said that there is no one size fits all reward.&nbsp; While money can be a powerful reward, it is
not the only effective incentive. Incentives like paid time off, meals,
merchandise, company gear, recognition on the company’s social media page are a
few other incentives that work well.</p>



<h3>4. Set Time Limits</h3>



<p>A contest that goes on indefinitely will lose its effectiveness. Setting a certain start and end time helps businesses raise participation and effort while the contest is in effect. If a long-term program is needed to meet the business goal (<em>for example improving a 5 percent improvement in customer satisfaction ratings every year</em>), consider conducting a series of consecutive contests rather than one long one. </p>



<p>It is important to recognize the end of the program where
top performers will be recognized and participants will be updated about the result
and how the program helped meeting the business goal. You can also conclude the
program with a small party to get the feedback that can help you make future
engagements more effective. </p>



<h3>5. Inspire Continued Involvement</h3>



<p>Contests should have the mechanisms to motivate participants
to stay involved, even after meeting the performance required or when they have
almost zero chance of winning. You can encourage agents to continue working
towards goals as groups. That way, they will be able to achieve more than they
can achieve individually.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Fusion has seen that providing rewards for meeting
performance thresholds is a great way to promote continued involvement and keep
participants motivated. Reward thresholds can also be used in combination with
more competitive contests to get more effective results.</p>



<h3>6. Communicate</h3>



<p>To maximize the effectiveness of a gamification program you need consistent communication before, during, and after the contest. This will help organizations maximize agent participation in a program, improve buy-in by helping agents understand why a certain goal or metric is vital, explain rules clearly so that there is no confusion or hard feelings about unclear rules, and make motivation more effective by bringing good performers into the limelight. Fusion has always found communication to be the key to successful gamification programs in a collection call center. </p>



<p>These are some of the ways a collection call center can improve its employee engagement and customer experience through the call center. The key is to find a defined goal, time limit, performance indicators, and the right motivator, and measuring it all through application analytics. If you rightly engage your employees through gamification, your employees will be inspired to perform at optimum level even after the program ended, resulting in better customer experience as well. </p>

<p>Customer service has gone through a sea of changes in the
recent past. So far, the changes have helped businesses improve the quality of
customer service and deliver state-of-the-art customer experience.</p>



<p>So, what made businesses think that a change in their
customer service model is necessary? Here are four realities that compelled
businesses to rethink:</p>



<h3>1. Smartphones In Every Pocket </h3>



<p>Nowadays one can find heavily featured smartphones being used in different parts of the world. Pew Research <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2999631/phones/pew-survey-shows-68-percent-of-americans-now-own-a-smartphone.html">reports</a> that in 2015 68% of American adults owned smartphones, almost double the 35% penetration in 2011. That means nearly every American has a supercomputer in his or her pocket.</p>



<p>The smartphone and the tablet are all-purpose devices that let us interact in a variety of modes &#8211; phone, email, text, web chat, video chat, social media, online forums and much more. As a result, people do not want to stick with just one mode of communication at a time: they switch modes as they please, and expect companies to keep up so that they don&#8217;t have to repeat their back-story to different personnel along the way. </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>With a smartphone in every pocket, companies can no longer stick to just one or two customer interaction channels. They should be present in a variety of channels so that a customer can reach them easily via the channel of his/her choice. When it comes to customer service, omnichannel is the way to go. </p>



<p>With <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/benefits-of-adopting-omnichannel-customer-support.html">omnichannel customer service</a>, a customer receives a seamless experience across all channels. Now, that is a customer service model that never goes out of style.</p>



<h3>2. 5G </h3>



<p>Over the next two years, the transition from 4G to 5G will make the public wireless network experience a huge 300 times faster. With <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-5g-everything-you-need-to-know">5G</a>, we will see devoted slices of spectrum, ready for tuning and optimization for specific applications and devices. The blend of these two phenomena, when met with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-internet-things-affect-customer-service-near-future-saraogi/">IoT</a>/M2M devices, will facilitate secure real-time data transfer. That means no delay. </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>In the age of 5G the faster a company can put data into action, the more value it can deliver. This is only possible when you put AI into the mix. When your customer service agents get <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">real-time assistance from AI</a>, it will be possible for them to assist your customers right away.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5G.jpg" alt="5G" class="wp-image-6617" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5G.jpg 650w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5G-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></figure></div>



<p>Here’s an example – if you get a call from your customer that his/her car broke down in the middle of the road, your customer service agent can take help of AI to resolve the issue quickly. AI can quickly show the agent the actual location of your customer, the location of the nearest tow truck and the time it will take the tow truck to arrive. It can also notify the tow truck, show the agent the location of the nearest clinic in case the customer needs medical assistance, saving your agent the time to manually look for the information and make the necessary calls. As a result, you can provide your customer with real-time assistance.</p>



<h3>3. Getting Smart </h3>



<p>Smart watches, smart cars, smart TVs, and other smart
devices continue to have a mammoth impact on consumer-oriented experiences.
Companies are building customer experiences around smart connected devices and
reshaping customer expectations in the process. The effect in the B2B segment
will be just as remarkable and will go beyond the automatic or single-tap
wireless updating of software features and bug fixes. </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>For most people, the best customer experience would be one that provides problem resolution without them having to know about it. Otherwise, one where the device notifies customer service based on a data trigger, empowering the user to help solve the issue on his terms.</p>



<p>As we shoot up the connectivity, contact center agents and technicians will increasingly interact not only with people but also with a wide range of devices, requiring these experts to hone their skills to handle different questions and complex situations.</p>



<h3>4. Big Data Getting Bigger</h3>



<p>Considering the ABI Research <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240227341/IoT-enabled-devices-to-cross-40-billion-by-2020">report</a>
that IoT/M2M will reach 40 billion in 2020, it is safe to say that connected
devices will soon outnumber people 5:1 or more. And they will generate a lot of
data.&nbsp; To deliver excellent customer
service businesses has to process this data to put the right information into
the right Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>At present customer service agents get access to just the performance information and customer data available in the CRM. That is a small slice of data that is often segmented. To use big data to its full potential, businesses have to analyze all data points and spread it across an organization along with other data. AI, data science, and machine learning can help you with that. </p>



<p>These advanced technologies will help you process big data faster, analyze the data to get better understanding of your customers and their expectations and using the same for future customer interactions. They will help agents get the full picture and deliver faster resolution, create more upsell/cross-sell opportunities, and ultimately deliver a superior customer experience.</p>



<p>Smartphones, 5G, devices, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wearable-technology-change-face-customer-service-kishore-saraogi/">wearables</a>, as well as big data, will continue to bring positive changes in customer service. Is your customer service ready to deliver new customer experience? </p>

<p>It was an absolute proud moment to see all great minds think in unison to help eradicate major problems in the company.&nbsp; The takeaways were truly abundant as the activity came to a close c/o Program Manager Deborah Jane &#8220;<em>DJ</em>&#8221;&nbsp;Labastida.&nbsp; Everyone cannot wait for next year&#8217;s summit.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, all Management members, Delegates, and Leaders went home with smiles in their faces with the commitment to: &#8220;<strong><em>Transform Tomorrow Together</em></strong>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The success of your debt collection efforts often depends on the effectiveness of your phone work. While following <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/are-there-laws-that-limit-what-debt-collectors-can-say-or-do-en-329/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</a> is an essential part of any debt collection process, the tone, timing, and framing of the conversation of the collection executive can make or break the call.</p>



<p>Having decades of experience in handling debt collection
calls on behalf of our clients, Fusion has in-depth knowledge on how to improve
your debt collection calls.&nbsp; Here we
share a few tips that can help you improve your debt collection efforts: </p>



<h2>Tips for Improving Debt Collection Calls</h2>



<h3><strong>Things to Remember:</strong></h3>



<p>While making <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/collection-services.html">debt collection calls</a> one must follow the letter of the law stating the best practices for A/R recovery. Apart from the legal ramifications, you must also keep in mind debt collection calls are made on behalf of your business and therefore, you should maintain the professional courtesy on the call. Remember, in this age of social media, one step out of the line can make your brand viral for all the wrong reasons. </p>



<p>Therefore, you must stay positive yet in-control of your
debt collection calls. A confident tone will earn you a better response from
your customers and help you meet the needs of your business without damaging
the company-customer relationship. </p>



<p>So how to prepare for success while making debt collection
calls? Here are some tried and tested tips:<strong>
&#8211; </strong></p>



<h3>1.    Be Proactive </h3>



<p>following up after sending the product or providing service
or one or two days prior to the due date may help you avoid non-payment.
Therefore, you must proactively interact with your customers and ask them if
everything was satisfactory and whether they have received the invoice.&nbsp; This will also help you maintain a better
customer-company relationship.</p>



<h3>2.    Be Prepared </h3>



<p>Before making the call gather and have in front of you as
much information about your customer and the debt as you can, including having
the file and all the invoices at hand. Fusion always advocates having all the
data at the agent’s fingertip.&nbsp; It helps
them improve the success rate of their collection calls.</p>



<h3>3.    Get Your Conversation Pointers Ready </h3>



<p>Before making a collection call, you must jot down the
pointers you want to talk about in a call.&nbsp;
This will help you stay in control over the conversation and get back on
track in case the interaction goes off the track. </p>



<h3>4.    Smile During the Call<strong> </strong></h3>



<p>While the customer can’t see your face, smiling can lighten
your tone of voice. This way, you will sound more positive and confident.&nbsp; Fusion has always encouraged its collection
agents to smile on call.&nbsp; It brings a
positive impact on the call.&nbsp; </p>



<h3>5.    Use the Person’s Name</h3>



<p>A person’s name is the sweetest thing to his ears and
addressing by their name adds the personal touch to the call creating a better
customer experience.&nbsp; However, overdoing
it will make the customer feel irritated.</p>



<h3>6.    Speak Confidently and Concisely</h3>



<p>Conveying a concise message in a confident tone can help you get a better response from your customers. However, you must never get emotional on collection calls or you will lose the control and the other party will take advantage of it.  If you feel emotional, you should wait for a while before answering. </p>



<p>Sure, it is difficult to keep emotions at bay especially while dealing with tricky customers. But a tricky customer can use your emotion against you. For this reason, it is always better to outsource your debt collection service to an experienced debt collection agency.  </p>



<h3>7.    Listen Carefully but also use Silence to Control the Conversation</h3>



<p>You need to be a good listener on a debt collection call.
Once you deliver your message in a concise way, you should listen to what the
other party has to say in this matter.&nbsp;
However, do not let the other party take control of the call. You can
use silence to take control back as and when necessary.</p>



<h3>8.    Stay Calm, Even if the Customer Gets Upset</h3>



<p>Not all collection calls go smoothly. During some calls,
emotions run high and the customer gets upset.&nbsp;
However, you must stay calm in such situations.&nbsp; If you too get emotional, the purpose of the
call will be ruined and you will have to start afresh. </p>



<h3>9.    Take Notes </h3>



<p>Documenting everything that is said, including the
customer&#8217;s feedback, can help you in case of any dispute. </p>



<h3>10.    Don&#8217;t Jump to Conclusions<strong> </strong></h3>



<p>The initial collection call should aim to confirm that the
debt has not been paid. This will ensure you are not alienating an otherwise
good customer. The unpaid invoice may be a miscommunication, and not a
collection issue at all, so you want to be careful. During our vast experience
in providing debt collection services, we have seen that a mistake from the
accounts department can lead to such problems. </p>



<h3><strong>11</strong>.    Give Options</h3>



<p>Suggesting options like paying in installments can help the
debtor clear their dues faster. If the person you are calling agrees to pay by
credit card, you must ensure that he/she signs the statement. You can fax them
the authorization form and have them fax it back after signing. Do not leave
anything to chances.</p>



<h3>12.    Get a Commitment</h3>



<p>Without a commitment from a customer to pay, the call is
potentially wasted. Whether it’s a partial or full payment, or a commitment to
pay at a certain date is essential for a successful collection call.</p>



<h3>13.    Conclude Well</h3>



<p>Before ending the call, you must convey the summary of the
entire call to the debtor party, including how and when they will make the payment
and depending on the mode of payment ask the debtor to confirm when the payment
has been made.</p>



<h3>14.    Keep in Interaction Open</h3>



<p>Someone who may not be able to pay up may be able to pay
later, so keep the conversation open. You can also help them figure out how to
get the money without paying big interest. This way you can carry on your
negotiation and still can maintain a good relationship with your customer. </p>



<p>These are some of the tips that can help you make professional quality debt recovery calls. Having problems handling collection calls on your own? Fusion can help. We are a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/collection-services.html">licensed debt collection services provider</a> who has decades of experience in providing debt recovery services to numerous clients.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With self-service on the rise, many people believe that the
time is up for live human agents who have been the backbone of call center and
customer service industry. Fusion respectfully begs to differ. </p>



<p>Having more than 15 years of experience in the call center
industry, we have studied consumer behavior closely. And while customer support
has changed a lot over the years thanks to technological advancements like
self-service and AI, live agents still remain the most preferred choice for
customer support, especially in the complex cases. </p>



<p>Here are a few of our observations on the role of live
agents in the modern customer service industry:</p>



<h3>1. People Still Want To Interact With A Human Agent</h3>



<p>Customer service encounters through social media or self-service don’t always leave customers feeling great confidence. On the other hand, interacting with a fellow human can make your customers feel reassured. </p>



<p>Even the tech-savvy <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/provide-quality-customer-service-to-the-millennials.html">millennials</a> who prefer self-service and other technology-rich customer service channels, resort to interacting with live customer service agents via voice or <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">chat</a> when they face a complex issue.  </p>



<p>Therefore, live agents are still very much relevant in the modern customer service scene and if anything, they play a far more significant role today than the role it used to play earlier.</p>



<h3>2. Customers Want Easy Access To Live Agents</h3>



<p>No matter how technologically advanced a call center becomes, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/engage-your-agents-xfactor-quality-customer-experience.html">there is no alternative of human agents</a>.  Even today, customers are more comfortable to convey their unique issues to a human agent than to a chatbot or IVR. Therefore, customers must be given the choice to talk to a live human agent and the option should be clearly conveyed to the customer. Many businesses these days think so as well.</p>



<p>In the Customer Contact Week Digital market study, <a href="https://www.customercontactweekdigital.com/content-auto-download/5be9b822d1d92e406f3b64d1">64%</a> of respondents agreed that customers must have easy access to a live human agent.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY.jpg" alt="THE FUTURE OF THE CONTACT CENTER IN 2019" class="wp-image-6593" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY.jpg 801w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-300x285.jpg 300w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-768x729.jpg 768w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-750x712.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></figure>



<p>As a call center with over 15 years of experience, Fusion has also seen that a customer is far more comfortable in discussing their issues with a human agent than telling it all to a faceless machine entity. They crave for the empathy that only a live human agent can deliver.</p>



<h3>3. Live Agents Can Handle Complex Issues Better</h3>



<p>All the issues handled by customer service can predominantly
be classified into two groups –</p>



<ul><li>Simple issues or inquiries </li><li>Complex problems</li></ul>



<p>Simple issues can be defined as issues that can be handled
within a single interaction or a basic issue reporting that can be resolved by
the company without additional customer input. These issues generally are
frequent and reoccurring and therefore, addressing them with automated channels
like knowledge-based systems, social media, improved website forms, text
messages, and chat systems makes complete sense. </p>



<p>However, when the problem is complex, automated channels fail to effectively resolve them. For this reason, most complex issues are handled over the phone.</p>



<p>It takes more time to explain the problem in detail so that the customer service agent can understand it, analyze it, and work on providing the resolution. However, the process can be improved by integrating AI with human agents.</p>



<h3>4. Artificial Intelligence Should Complement Human Agents Instead Of Replacing Them</h3>



<p>While <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Artificial Intelligence (opens in a new tab)">Artificial Intelligence</a> or AI is the buzzword in modern customer support, it is still not in a position where it can replace a human agent. AI is to go a long way before it can master the art of natural language processing (NLP) and empathy. Instead, it can be used to aid a live agent and make their job easier.  </p>



<p>For example – if one of your customers has an issue
regarding their bills, a live agent will take some time to find relevant
information. &nbsp;When AI is brought into the
scene, it will be able to show the agent the past interaction history on the
screen along with itemized billing so that it becomes easier for the agent to
promptly resolve the issue and ask about the previous issue the customer
faced.&nbsp; It will up the customer
satisfaction level.&nbsp; </p>



<h4>Conclusion: </h4>



<p>Human agents were, are, and will be occupying the central position of the customer service industry.  The chance of AI replacing live agents looks very slim in the near future as AI needs a lot of improvement to be at par with a human agent in terms of emotional intelligence. </p>

<p>In this competitive age, good customer
experience holds the key to customer loyalty.&nbsp;
In order to provide a good experience, businesses must focus on
delivering exceptional customer support that meets, if not overcomes your
customer’s expectations. </p>



<p>Customers today are exposed to the gold
standard of customer service. They are aware of their options and the power
they have. Therefore, they have high expectations from a business.</p>



<h2>So, What Does Your Customer Want?</h2>



<p>They want a company to promptly respond to
their queries and issues via the channel of their choice.&nbsp; If they wish to change the communication
channel, they should be able to do so seamlessly without having to repeat
themselves. </p>



<p>Today most of the companies provide customer support via a number of channels including <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/voice.html">voice</a>, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">chat</a>, email, social media, instant messaging, web, and mobile. However, the challenge is to integrate those channels for providing seamless interaction with consistent experience at multiple touch-points across the life cycle of a customer.  Such a feat is only achievable by adopting an omnichannel approach. </p>



<p>Fusion advocates <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="omnichannel customer support (opens in a new tab)">omnichannel customer support</a> to provide customers with a cohesive and integrated customer experience irrespective of where and how a customer chooses to reach you. Omnichannel customer support brings you a number of benefits. Here are the top benefits of adopting omnichannel customer support.</p>



<h2>Benefits of Omnichannel Customer Support &#8211;</h2>



<h3>1. Gain Greater Customer Insights</h3>



<p>Customer support channels such as chat, social media, forums, and emails, leave a recorded written customer trace. You can use this data to accumulate customer information in its context. It will help you better understand how the customers choose to interact with your brand and their needs across all channels.</p>



<p>Having this data in one place will enable you to take proactive actions and create effective strategies to tweak and enhance your customer support and deliver better customer experience.</p>



<h3>2. Serve Your Customers Where They Are</h3>



<p>Customers today want to make purchases on their own terms, at their convenience, and in a way that suits them the best. To build a sustainable business, you must satisfy your customers. That means you have to appeal to them wherever they are.</p>



<p>No matter what channel they choose to interact with you, you must provide seamless, cohesive support via the same. If the customer wishes to change their channel, they should be able to continue with the conversation across the channel as well.</p>



<p>Customers today are more powerful and aware
of the options they have. Therefore, they expect more from brands.&nbsp; They expect to get the best experience
wherever they are — whether online or offline. Providing it to them will not
only improve your conversion rate but will also increase a customer’s loyalty.</p>



<h3>3. Enhance the Shopping Experience Everywhere</h3>



<p>Your customer can choose to shop online,
in-app, or in a brick and mortar store, and still expect the same level of
customer experience. </p>



<p>For example – a customer looks for a product he has seen online at a brick and mortar store and the in-store representative finds the product out of stock.  He can then place an order for the same in their e-commerce store, to be delivered at the customer&#8217;s doorstep. </p>



<p>This way, omnichannel customer support can
enhance the shopping experience.</p>



<h3>4. Enhance Real-time Customer Support</h3>



<p>As customers’ demands are increasing by the day, businesses are making efforts to meet them. Customers want their needs to be met and they want it now. If you cannot deliver a real-time answer to their questions, or provide instant support, you are indirectly asking them to leave.</p>



<p>Real-time customer support boost customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. With <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-omnichannel-customer-service-best-practices-to-boost-customer-experience.html">omnichannel customer support</a>, it is possible to offer real-time support across a number of channels, creating a seamless customer experience.</p>



<h3>5. Happier, More Engaged and Loyal Customer</h3>



<p>When you have omnichannel customer support in place, your customers will be able to switch between channels seamlessly without feeling the frustration of having to repeat the issues. Also having up-to-date data in one place means faster resolution of issues. Such things definitely add to customer satisfaction rate and result in happier customers. Everyone knows that a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/start-by-keeping-your-customers-happy.html">happy customer</a> is the greatest thing for a business.</p>



<p>These are the vital benefits of adopting an omnichannel approach when it comes to customer service. By adopting an omnichannel approach you can enhance your customer experience, stay ahead of the competition with impeccable customer service, earn loyal and engaged customers who keep coming back, improving your business performance. </p>

<p>Here’s an example – while browsing a site the live chat agent starts an interaction with you stating its various products and features that are already given on the webpage and do not give you a chance to convey what you are looking for. How would you feel then? </p>



<p>It is natural to get annoyed at such behavior. Proactive chat
only enhances the customer experience when it is used the way it is supposed
to.&nbsp; Your agents must know what works the
best and what does not.&nbsp; To save you the
time, Fusion brings you the best tips and tricks to turn a bad online
experience into a winning one.</p>



<h2>1. Leverage analytics to find the right time</h2>



<p>The key to <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">providing quality customer service through proactive chat</a> is using the analytics to your benefit. You can use analytics to determine many factors like:</p>



<ul><li>Average browsing time of a visitor.</li><li>His/her behavior for every page of the website.</li></ul>



<p>Based on the information gathered through analytics, you can
decide the appropriate wait time for sending out a proactive message.</p>



<h2>2. Track referring URLs</h2>



<p>In the present age, your work does not end after placing promotional links at different places online, you need to also keep track of its aftermath.  Tracking referring URLs can create great conversion opportunities. You must identify the users who came to your website through the referral links and send out proactive chat invitations to them.</p>



<p>In case they came to your site grab some promotional offers featured on the referring website, a proactive chat is the best way to direct them to the offer page. Proactive chat can also be used to resolve any other query they might have regarding the offer. </p>



<h2>3. Provide 24/7 customer support</h2>



<p>Customers these days expect instant query resolution. Moreover, they expect round the clock support 365 days a year from you.  You must be there to guide/assist them at any point of the day.  And that means having some proven customer touch points on a 24/7 basis.  These touch points include email, VOIP channels, social media platforms, live chat and more.</p>



<p>In this situation, proactive chat can be your best option &#8211; it helps help you to know your potential customers and their queries before they approach you and provide the most satisfactory solution. </p>



<h2>4. Use proactive chat tools for smarter communications</h2>



<p>As visual learners, your customers will learn better when you
explain you explain facts about your products and services through demos. You
can use this to your advantage and employ tools like live voice chat, live
video chat to educate them.&nbsp; You can also
redirect your customers to relevant pages using co-browsing or proactively
offer them links to support videos through chat.</p>



<p>These tips can help you improve your lackluster proactive chat
support into an effective tool to improve customer satisfaction. </p>

<p>Chatbots have been on the rise since a couple of years and
have already gained popularity. Chatbots can help businesses interact with
their customers and prospects in a new way using messaging apps, the latest
technology, and Artificial Intelligence. </p>



<h2>What is a Chatbot?</h2>



<p>A chatbot is a service that can interact with you just like a real person. Powered by rules and  Artificial Intelligence, chatbots are programmed to simulate a real conversation with users through a chat interface. They are based on machine learning to imitate human conversation and react to service requests.</p>



<p>AI helps them learn the language, human tone, and behavior with every interaction, which in turn helps them to be more intelligent and serve the users better. </p>



<p>For a better understanding of how chatbots can contribute to
your business, let us find the top 7 benefits of chatbots:</p>



<h2>1. Being Present on Messaging Platforms</h2>



<p>Today messaging applications have more users than social
media network. And as customers today think that chat is a convenient and
faster way to interact with a business, businesses today have the chance to
reach more audience via chatbots while staying trendy.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The Majority of smartphone users today do not want to
download new apps. So, businesses can integrate their chatbot in one of the
popular platforms that the customers use on a daily basis such as &#8211; Facebook,
Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. It will also save you time and money. </p>



<h2>2. Improved Customer Service</h2>



<h4>A. Extensive Customer Assistance</h4>



<p>According to a <a href="https://econsultancy.com/83-of-online-shoppers-need-support-to-complete-a-purchase-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">survey</a>, 83% of online shoppers want assistance during shopping. So, your customers may need assistance at any time. Additionally, shoppers may also face navigation issues, or have queries about registration, payment, checkout, and delivery or about the product itself.</p>



<p>In such situations, chatbots can provide real-time assistance through interactive communication over text and voice. They can also provide customers with important relevant information from knowledge base, blogs, tutorial videos and so on.</p>



<h4>B. Always-Available Customer Support</h4>



<p>A great 24/7 customer service has a positive impact on customer satisfaction. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">Chatbots can help you improve the customer support</a> process by quickly giving automated answers to repetitive questions immediately and forwarding the complex ones to a human agent.</p>



<p>Apart from that, chatbots allow businesses to attend more queries at the same time, allowing companies to scale up their operation to new markets globally.</p>



<h4>C. Proactive Customer Interaction</h4>



<p>Companies can also use chatbots to start <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/proactive-customer-service-and-how-to-start-practicing-it.html">proactive customer interactions</a> regarding any issue, any time of the day. This will make your customers feel that your brand cares for them on a 24/7 basis. This can help improve your brand perception in the long run.</p>

<h2>3. Increased Customer Engagement</h2>



<p>Chatbots can be a great tool for customer engagement.
Chatbots can provide the customers with a specific slice of information and
lead the interaction based on the user input at that time.&nbsp; This way, chatbots never provides a dull
interaction with irrelevant and useless information resulting in better
engagement. </p>



<h2>4. Monitoring Consumer Data and Gaining Insights</h2>



<p>Businesses can make changes in their service/products based on the feedback chatbots collect through simple questions. As chatbots are also capable of tracking purchasing patterns and consumer behavior by monitoring user data, they can also help a company to decide marketing strategies.</p>



<p>Companies can use chatbots to track consumer request and responses, predict responses based on the language and direct the chatbot to suggest an alternative product or service. </p>



<h2>5. Cost Savings</h2>



<p>Implementing a full functioning chatbot is cheaper and faster than creating a cross-platform app or hiring chat support agents for each task. Businesses today can <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="choose from ready-made applications (opens in a new tab)">choose from ready-made applications</a> developed by Facebook, Microsoft, and other IT giants.</p>



<p>Being automated solutions, chatbots can handle many customers at once, saving employee costs and eliminating the scope for human errors. Finally, as customers can access chatbots easily within seconds and interact immediately, the cost of user acquisition also comes down.</p>



<p>These are some of the major benefits chatbots bring to your business. with technological advancements, chatbots will become smarter, better and more effective. As chatbot gradually gain maturity, this is the right time to adopt this new technology and give your business an edge.  </p>
