This is an undoubtedly lucrative business. If you are thinking about starting such a business, I will surely encourage you. Because of this business provides better return against your investments. However, the income from such a business actually depends on the number of clients you have in your clientele. The more clients you have the more revenue you can generate. This is as simple as that. Besides it also depends on how many hours a day you will work. The more hours you will work the more you can earn. If you run a <strong><a title="24 hour answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/ ">24 hour answering service</a></strong>, you will surely earn more. Usually the clients pay set amount of money every month for specific number of calls. If there are additional calls, they will pay at a pre-decided rate for the extra calls.</p>
