								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often marketers browses various Whitepapers, attends different webinars to know which trends or approaches can let them bring changes in their annual scorecard/bottom-line.</p>
<p>Exchanging notes with the industry experts and the leading entrepreneurs, marketers have started to share their non-core tasks to offshore partners.</p>
<p>As opting for contact centers is a dubious and strategic move, many leaders used to stay away from offshoring due to conventional fears.</p>
<p>In present day, however, many have given up their fears and have started to use outsourcing as a tactic to make reliable profits. In a previous blog, we have shown how Asset Managers of today <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/resolving-assetwealth-management-conundrums-with-next-generation-outsourcing.html" target="_blank">overcame their limitations</a> and chose outsourcing as a strategic tool to cut down on cost and bring change in the service levels.</p>
<p>Now the question is &#8211; How an outsourcing partner can help business to make profitable shifts in their bottom-line. What futuristic approaches are making contact center help business to expand their customer base?</p>
<p>Fusion is going to share three big contact center futuristic trends that will help B2B and B2C clients irrespective of their business size to produce a strong chain of customer and grow a rock-solid scorecard.</p>
<h3>Customer Expectation Going to Rise and That’s a Positive Trait</h3>
<p>In a business, we need to grow our foresight and speculate what might happen next. With excellent customer service from notable vendors, consumer now wants to receive similar treatment from every business or services in nooks and corners of the world. It does not matter whether you are a utility service or a technical support.</p>
<p>When a customer knocks your business, he or she comes predetermined about receiving a higher-level service. With the in-house agents, you cannot accomplish this service goal as they miss the desired skills to provide top-notch customer support.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a contact center can offer your customers a supreme level of customer service.</p>
<p>Some latest features such as customer giving call backs or having Live Video Chat/WebChat with respective agents are simply amazing. It serves your business with real-time benefits. Often, it is hard to equip your in-house agents with state-of-the-art business tools, as they are expensive.</p>
<p>A contact center is always ready to initiate any kind of marketing campaign. So, leveraging your services to contact centers is going to apprehend business goals and will be cost saving.</p>
<p>A good futuristic point that makes a contact center unique from in-house teams is that – <em>contact center people knows what drives a better customer experience.</em></p>
<h3>Communications Using More Than One Channel</h3>
<p>With the use of contact center, a business can eventually increase their customer base just not locally or nationally, but globally. How is it possible? It is simply because call centers offer exposure to your business through a number of channels.</p>
<p>According to the recent study, 77 percent of the customer prefers to use multi-channel in order to seek a service. Hence, the key ingredient is to keep your customer happy and offer them with supports in the real-time.</p>
<p>As said earlier, consumers, today, prefer to use more than one channel. They use a set of new channels such as phone, email, web-based chat, SMS, social media, click to call, screen sharing, etc. This shows that arrays of online digital channels are popular among customers.</p>
<p>It is tricky enough to understand how different types of customer use different channels to seek services. Hence, it is essential for your business to consider <a href="http://bigdoor.com/blog/2013/11/01/a-quick-guide-to-customer-journey-mapping/" target="_blank">customer journey mapping</a>. However, do you have the time to initiate the mapping? If not, contact centers are ready to help you.</p>
<p>How do contact centers help to expand your customer base? How contact centers steer the communication channels to generate positive customer perspective?</p>
<ul>
<li>They move with a definite goal based on you company services and undertakings</li>
<li>Helps your business to decide up on the key points that makes or breaks a relationship with your customer</li>
<li>They involve everyone a prospective customer, or an irate customer, even the one-time or seasonal buyers</li>
</ul>
<h3>Live Agents Offer fresh Lease of Life in Customer Service</h3>
<p>When it comes to customer service, the live conversation via Live Chat or Video Chat has a large role to play. With the rise in self-service options, the quantity of transactions over the live conversation channels is less, but there are instances when the self-services fall short. This make the live agents more focused.</p>
<p>In popular surveys, we find that depending on the nature of the inquiry customer prefers to use the channels. For simple inquiries such as, “<em>What’s My Balance?</em>”, “<em>What’s The Status of My Shipment?</em>” online self-serve help and email are the clear winners.</p>
<p>However, when the inquiry is complex such as a failure in the technical aspects or may be a failure in the order supply, “<em>live agents</em>” are the dominant choice.</p>
<p>Contact centers utilize the Live Chat channels in the most refined manner. They make it viable by –</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilizing the best resources and identifying the key opportunities for chat to analyze website data and customer feedback</li>
<li>Personalizes the interaction that your in-house agents often fail to initiate</li>
<li>They escalate the service to voice when it matter for your business.</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as you leverage the customer support to an outsourcing partner, you will be able to open to viable options of expanding your customer base. Your business will be exposed to a larger demographic, and you will observe a steady escalation in your ROI.</p>
<h3>What Customer’s Feel About Your Business, From the Desk of Fusion –</h3>
<p>At Fusion, we have worked with a number of B2B and B2C companies, who outsource their customer support simply not to expand, but to make their customer “<em>keep coming back</em>.” In these 9 years, we have learned that the customers like someone to take care of them when they need the assistance.</p>
<p>With contact centers such as Fusion, it is possible to attain your customer almost 24/7/6365 days that too in real time with real assistance.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we have realized that positive and happy customers are the keys to unlock reliable profits for companies, irrespective of B2B or B2C.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often mitigated by firm limitations, asset managers used to avoid outsourcing that their counterparts in the credit card and mortgage industry preferred to use.</p>
<p>With the change in the operational and global financial structures, offshoring has become a necessity for the investors. It is now used as a strategic tool by their asset managers to cut down costs, bring change in the service levels and support differentiated offerings.</p>
<h3>What Has Made The Asset Managers To Adapt Offshore Outsourcing?</h3>
<p>Asset managers are conservative and risk averse class. However, what made them changed their mindset and embrace outsourcing as part of their business model? Well, there are three basic reasons, which say why they had a mind shift:</p>
<p><strong>Change in Global Business Model</strong></p>
<p>Asset managers have realized that, in an ever changing global business model, traditional ways are not going to work out. With rapid globalization, customers now demands international assets and want to invest in global capital markets. In the last five years, global and emerging market funds have aggregated to USD 400 billion, says Oliver Wyman in a <a href="http://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/global/en/2014/mar/Wholesale_Investment_Banking_2014.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>. This astonishing figure is making asset managers fall for business process outsourcing.</p>
<p><strong>Change in Demands</strong></p>
<p>Well, today’s complex market movement is seen as multiple arrays of asset classes and products available to the institutional and retail investors. With the rise in demand and information, change in customer behavioral pattern is compelling the asset managers to outsource their business.</p>
<p><strong>Cost Reduction</strong></p>
<p>Asset managers tend to transform price and value equation, target right customers with advisory services, and provide enhanced customer support but all within a fixed budget. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_11/b4219041484091.htm" target="_blank">RIA</a>s (<em>Registered Investment Advisors</em>) want to focus on operating costs as business is turning complex, thus finding out a partner who can leverage cost-effective solution has become significant. Hence, asset managers’ choose next generation offshoring as a strategic solution.</p>
<h3>How State-of-the-Art BPOs Can Help Investment Managers?</h3>
<p>Well, Fusion had a face-to-face conversation with some asset managers, who have shown interest in outsourcing their business processes. However, most of them want an instant solution to higher transaction costs and daily paperwork. They now look for partners who can mitigate risks and strike a balance between cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Well, most of the state-of-the-art BPOs like Fusion are reliable and provides industry specific solutions to investment management space, so choosing us as a partner will reduce risk and threats that asset managers often fear.</p>
<p>How Next Generation Offshoring Can Provide Industry Specific Solutions?</p>
<ul>
<li>With the offshoring, the asset management community will adhere to a number of opportunities that can tailor traditional business model, yet build new capabilities for the marketplace.</li>
<li>Offshore providers of today can take on ownership of the transactional back and middle office activities with reduced risk and can embolden back office activities related to account set-up, data conversion and work maintenance.</li>
<li>Offshore delivery models are going to provide adequate scope that can have high impacts on the operating margins.</li>
<li>Offshoring is going to entail additional value beyond cost arbitrage increasing front-to-back agility.</li>
<li>Right provider can help asset managers build and support sophisticated asset allocation models, enhancing investors’ decision-making ability.</li>
<li>Moreover, the provider can provide investment managers with deep knowledge on underlying processes and metric, develop a variable unit pricing model and will allow more flexibility than traditional FTE pricing structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, question might arise among the strategist and market critics – <i>“Whether or not a next-gen offshore provider can improve value-equation for the asset management industry?”</i></p>
<p>A huge gap underlies between extent of domain knowledge and track records delivering end-to-end processes that providers must overcome to serve the investment management space. This business is relatively complex compared to credit card and mortgage industry.</p>
<p>Asset or wealth management sectors in offshore locations like Philippines and India has a substantial rise down the last few years. India is handling large captive operations which continue to generate consistent results. Thus, a number of retail brokerage firms and asset managers have started to leverage outsourcing benefits from simple account set up and compliance reporting to more complex licensed transactions and portfolio advisory services.</p>
<h3>What Will Compel Asset Managers To Choose Outsourcing As A Strategic Tool?</h3>
<p>The next-gen outsourcing is going to provide a host of benefits to the asset managers such as ability to customize, flexibility in prices that can meet peak and trough of the market and can gain deep insight on the end-to-end processes. Offshoring industry will lift their abilities to provide service in a consistent and transparent manner, to gain confidence of this risk-averse class. At the same time, asset managers must evaluate outsourcing in a more strategic way.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s Move With the Trend</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to rethink and evaluate traditional back-office outsourcing. Now investment industry can get a more comprehensive mix of offshoring with a front office, middle office and back office. Moreover, wealth/asset management industry must focus on right shoring partners as they can serve with onsite and offshore services to meet end-to-end customer needs.</p>
<p>With next-gen offshoring, investment management space can enjoy a larger value play. As it will let them gain competitive advantage and lever improved customer experience 24X7 through multiple channels.</p>
<p>Fusion holds a simple thought on this mindset change of asset managers and their choice of leveraging business to offshoring people. We say:</p>
<p><i>“Global BPOs are just a catalyst to an asset manager, providing similar services just like we provide others. We invest in delivery models that can meet all complex needs of the concerned industry conveniently. Rather we are ready to serve anyone who looks up for highly valuable opportunity.”</i><i></i></p>
<p>So, join the revolution with the next-generation outsourcing today!</p>
