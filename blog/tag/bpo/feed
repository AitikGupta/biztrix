								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, India as a BPO industry has some distinct advantages, and it has helped them for a decade to climb the dominant position. At present India is holding the topmost position in the global BPO market, capturing all revenue, shares, and exports. If we consider India’s position back in the 1980’s when IT infrastructure has just launched their session, we will witness a vast change. At that time, China was India’s chief rival and India was much behind them when it comes to English-speaking workforce and IT infrastructure. However, the global market saw the potential of BPO growth in India in the future. India has climbed the ladder of success despite meeting challenges in the global BPO market. Some of the prominent challenges include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A poor business environment that does not facilitate IT BPO growth in India</li>
<li>High tax rates and government support were quite less</li>
<li>Issue of Indian accents since most of the processes were voice-based services</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it is year 2013, Fusion BPO Services a leading IT BPO company in India is going to show through this write up, that’s how well India can retain the BPO Edge in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>We know that the Indian BPO Industry has matured a lot. We have that skilled workforce whom we have trained in various outsourcing model and have given them the scope to understand the entire cycle of outsourcing. You have so many regions who have started to invest in the BPO industry and are giving a tough compete to India.</p>
<p>In the midst of this situation, a big question strikes the mind of almost all – will it be possible for India to retain their BPO popularity? Will the outsourcers continue to choose India as their favorite destination? Well, Fusion gives thumbs up and says that India will continue to grow in the near future. Well we have 5 reasons to support our viewpoint.</p>
<h3>#1 Outsourcing Skills to Drive India towards Rising Growth</h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.sourcingline.com/" target="_blank">SourcingLine</a>, who compiled a global BPO database comprising all the key statistics like &#8211; competitiveness, resources and skills and business environment. Considering all the factors India emerged as the most popular and preferred BPO destination with an overall outsourcing index of 7.1 and other outsourcing destinations that follow India are &#8211; Indonesia (6.9), China (6.4), Bulgaria (6.4), and Philippines (6.3)</p>
<p>If you consider the individual index scores for the above three key criteria, India follows behind some destinations or leads them just by a few score, this includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>China has an index score of 6 as the nearest resource and skills competitor whereas India is at 5.6.</li>
<li>Philippines hit the index score of 9 with reference to cost competitiveness and India follows it at 8.3.</li>
<li>China score 6 at the index for business environment, and India is at 4.2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>#2 Reworking on the Disadvantages</h3>
<p>We know that the global outsourcing trends keep on changing. For this changing trend, the competing nation tries hard to turn their disadvantages to advantages. Well, if it is so, then we will say reworking on the disadvantages is a hard task. It is not possible for India to improve their business index faster than China. Neither India nor China can offer competitive cost like the Philippines. However, we keep our finger crossed to achieve the basic limit of BPO service excellence in the near future reworking on this key features.</p>
<h3>#3 Low Wages Make It a Deliberate Choice</h3>
<p>Costs are the most crucial thing and the determinant factor for the rise and the growth of a BPO region. Offshore outsourcing aims to save the wages. It is the low wages which are paid to the junior resources to cut the companies cost. People like the IT engineers and web developers in India are hired at 11% the cost of those in US, according to the data provided by <a href="http://www.sourcingline.com/outsourcing-location/india" target="_blank">SourcingLine</a>. Indian staffs in the senior levels get 30% of their wages of what their US counterparts get. It helps businesses to save wages by offering business processes to India.</p>
<h3>#4 Real Estate and Tax Costs are Getting BPO Savvy</h3>
<p>You have many other factors that help BPO to reduce cost, like that of infrastructure cost. However, it eventually does not save a lot for the BPO buyers as the prices of infrastructure keeps on shifting with increasing demand. Real estate costs generally vary with location. Many prime BPO destinations in India are there whose commercial spaces are sold at much higher price than New York. Even at times corporate taxes are unsupportive. However, the white paper released by the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/working_papers/ec200601a.pdf" target="_blank">US International Trade Commission</a> shows that tax benefits are trying to keep parallel with BPO after the 2013 budget and the real estate price are falling down to suit the global BPO market.</p>
<h3>#5 Market Share and Sector Size are High</h3>
<p>BPO industry accounts only 1% of the India’s GDP and less than 2% of its annual job creation. According to the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1666514" target="_blank">Gartner</a> Research, India at present accounts 39% of the world share in outsourcing business. Whereas India generates 40% revenue from the software and accounts, 70% of its total business exports services. NASSCOM reported that from 2002 to 2008 revenues of India has increased from 40% to 44% and it will continue to grow after 2012. Well, if we calculate the total revenue India BPO generates, we will see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>70% revenue comes from call centers</li>
<li>20% from the high and low volume data works</li>
<li>Remaining 10% comes from the high- value added functions</li>
</ul>
<p>India has been witnessing this steady growth in BPO sector since 2008. Well, it does have some prominent reasons like –</p>
<ul>
<li>Declining telecommunication rates</li>
<li>Low labor costs</li>
<li>New interactive software</li>
<li>Project management skills</li>
<li>Availability of skilled, educated and English-speaking labor pool</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the basic 5 reason, which throws limelight on the BPO growth in India. Fusion BPO services say that India will retain their BPO image for a long time due to their keen sense of boosting those services what they do best. India is going to have a close look at the competitors to improve their business environment, cost and resources in order to redefine their business.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Cut corners” and “increase the bottom line” are the two essential needs for every entrepreneur. To fulfill their goals at the minimum cost, business owners always keep searching for opportunities. Anxiety and stress are the common aspect that strikes every businessperson.</p>
<p>Outsourcing is the answer to entrepreneurs to bring down the cost without sacrificing much in executing related business process. However, this may be the reason why businesspersons become anxious as some of the processes will no longer be handled in-house.</p>
<p>Take a close look on the 5 ways to keep down the anxiety and enjoy all the benefits of outsourcing.</p>
<h3>1) Classify the Scope of Work</h3>
<p>When you engage with the outsourcing companies, it pays to have a scope of work. That is a statement or list of things that you want to be done. Before you think to head towards any kind of endeavor, outsourcing companies have their rules of engagement laid out to avoid finger pointing when a problem crops up.</p>
<p>Inform the outsourcing provider about your upfront requirements. Set the realistic expectations and put up metrics in place, which the outsourcing partner needs to hit.</p>
<h3>2) Do Not Choose On The Basis Of Price</h3>
<p>It is quite tempting, but to choose outsourcing services based on price is a big anxiety generator. You should not consider the price as the sole concern in picking a service provider. In order to buy the services of an outsourcing company, choose them on the basis of a wide variety of spectrums. You should try to maintain the balance between value and quality.</p>
<p>Price is the worst thing to consider, when you opt for a BPO company. Think of ways by which your outsourcing partner can cut costs and make the contract feasible.</p>
<h3>3) Check The Experience Of The Outsourcing Partner</h3>
<p>Look for an outsourcing provider with an excellent background on the business process in which you deal. Choose the partner who will generate quality outputs for you. At Fusion, we give our clients the scope to get more experience on their business space.</p>
<p>Check the track record of the outsourcing partner. Like, if you have a financial organization, then you might like to outsource the payroll. Check out how long the outsourcing partner has been with the payroll engaging system. Do make queries on the positive and negative feedback that other clients have to say on the chosen contractor.</p>
<h3>4) Assess Outsourcing Provider As A Regular Employee</h3>
<p>When you assess or evaluate an outsourcing provider, ask them questions just like you ask an organic employee. Choosing an outsourcing company is always subjective but that does not mean that you will stop yourself being objective.  Rather, ask for references and the performance of the service provider on their own accounts.</p>
<h3>5) Start Small</h3>
<p>Start small when you outsource your business to the leading BPO service providers. This will help you to pull back, when things do not run well. You will be saved from a lot of anxiety. You will also get an idea on how your provider performs before you can think of possible expansion.</p>
<p>Go ahead with the leading BPO companies like Fusion to engage yourself with the benefits of outsourcing and stay away from the anxiety.</p>
