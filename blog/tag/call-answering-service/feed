There are pros and cons associated with both systems in the <strong><a title="phone answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">phone answering service</a></strong> call centers; the businesses must make a suitable choice depending on their clients’ and customers’ needs.</p>
<p><strong>Voice enabled IVR</strong></p>
<p>The advantages are that it is much easier for the customers to say the answer or utter an option to the question asked by the call answering service, rather than typing the option on the keypad. For mobile users, this option is perfect. The menu options can be unlimited in this case, and the customers can also jump from option to option quite easily by just uttering words.</p>
<p>However, the customers must be sure not to speak in noisy conditions and when the network signals are low. If there are disturbances on lines, the call answering service will not be able to record and register what the customers are saying and hence the system too will not be able to act upon it.</p>
<p><strong>DTMF based IVR</strong></p>
<p>This option is perfect for the landline users and for people who use hands-free for mobile. Today, a lot of people are aware about tone dialing and know the usage of IVR through pressing the right keys. DTMF signals do not get distorted and the response is also made faster.</p>
<p>Howvere, this option may not be appropriate for the old people who have shaking and trembling fingers, as they might not be able to type the right keys in time.</p>

It is to be noted that all IVR systems have three kinds of cost components that must be considered apart from the upgrading costs and the general maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The first IVR cost component that is considered usually by <strong><a title="phone answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">phone answering service</a></strong> call centers is the cost of CTI hardware and the computer systems. This is a fixed as well as one-time cost, and the call answering service will not have to invest in it unless certain amount of capacity enhancement is required in future.</p>
<p>The second component is the cost involved in customized voice application. The IVR call flow implementation costs can also include integration with third party applications such as web services and customer relationship management (CRM). The call centers must either invest in in-house qualified man power or can get the voice application tool developed from the IVR software providers.</p>
<p>The third component is the telephone cost; the costs can be charged on per call per minute basis as per the convenience of the businesses and organizations. When human agents interact with the IVR callers in the phone answering service call centers, the call transfer cost gets very high in the long run. This is dependent on the call volume.</p>
<p>After the center decides what they need, on premise IVR system or hosted IVR, they can think about the cost components and deploy the right IVR system for the center.</p>

		<title>Implementation of Call Back Using IVR</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Call back feature is used in the live answering service call centers when callers call the numbers and then disconnects without waiting for a respondent to answer the call. The live answering service agents are required to dial the number back from where the missed call was made and get in touch with the person.</p>
<p>The call back feature is implemented through smart IVR that performs different tasks. The caller ID must be detected first and foremost by the <strong><a title="call answering services" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">call answering service</a></strong> and also looked up in a database to find out if the caller ID is registered for a call back service. In case, the caller ID that is detected is found to be a registered user for the call back service, an outbound call must be made to the number.</p>
<p>Once the caller ID takes the call, there must be a prompt for entering the phone number. The IVR system now makes another outbound call to the phone number that is entered at the prompt and then gets it bridged with the previous call.</p>
<p>The call back feature is a great tool for lowering the call costs and also effective when the phone answering service does not want the subscribers to make the support calls. This can be a substitute for the toll free numbers; when customers dial toll free numbers, they are not charged for the calls, but the call center has to pay per minute charges for the call. Thus, usage of IVR is a cost effective option for the call centers.</p>
