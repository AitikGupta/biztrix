								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new year marks new beginning. Every year, people from across the world make some spirited resolutions on New Year. So, last week we asked our agents what they want to achieve this New Year and got a huge response from them.</p>
<p>When we looked closely, we found that despite different answers there are some popular resolutions for most of them.</p>
<p>Here are the 5 most popular resolutions that our agents have made for 2015:-</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Learn New Skills to Improve Efficiency</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone wants to improve themselves and if their goal of self-improving has a positive impact on their profession – it brings them more joy. For this reason, a large section of our agents has chosen learning a new skill as their priority in their new year’s resolution.</p>
<p>Now did they have the same skill set in mind? Well, no.  Some wanted to get better organized, some wanted to work on their MS-Excel skills, and some wanted to learn a new language altogether. But all these resolutions had a common purpose – to aid them in their professional field as well as their personal lives.</p>
<p>Fusion is always ready to help its agents. We have different training sessions in which we train our agents on subjects like – time management, organization, corporate communication, etc. Our department heads are always willing to help young talents <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/fusions-take-on-employee-welfare-in-bpo.html" target="_blank">learn new skills</a> that will help them advance in their career.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Become a Better Team Player</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Together each achieve more – what can be a better definition of a team? In a team, everyone has got each other’s back. They help each other in tough issues, keep each other company in tense situations and together find ways to emerge from it.</p>
<p>A call center team is no exception.  Each agent helps their peers to deliver their best service to their clients. However, new agents often find it a little tough to adjust with the rest of the team.  At that time, it is the responsibility of the team to accommodate the new agents and make them feel at home. If they can do it, they will become a better team and good team players.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we often do some team building exercises to strengthen the bond between each team member. We strongly recommend that a team should also go for small outings and dinners. After all, a team that eats together stays together.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>Treat Each Caller with Empathy to Make them Feel Comfortable</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the age of state-of-the -art customer service, every customer wants to be pampered by call center agents every time they call the customer care.  And it is the agent’s responsibility to make each customer feel special with prompt service, first call issue resolution, and cordial behavior.  But is that enough?</p>
<p>In this age of multichannel connectivity, customers have become a fan of personalized attention.   To meet their demands, every call center agent first needs to understand their situation and then deliver a solution depending on the issue.  Therefore, they need to treat every customer with empathy. It will allow them to give each customer the personalized attention they require.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we always train the agents to <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/10-ways-customer-service-rep-grow-customer-empathy.html" target="_blank">treat every customer with empathy</a>. In case some agents feel that they are not being able to fully empathize with the customers, they can always opt for one of these trainings anytime.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Pay Attention to Fitness</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now this one needs no introduction.  It is on everyone’s New Year resolution list for 2015 (and pretty much for every year).  A fit body and healthy mind is a prerequisite of every aspect of one’s life &#8211; be it professional or personal.</p>
<p>However, maintaining the fitness can be quite challenging a task for the call center agents who work night shifts or graveyard shifts. Therefore, fitness has always been a matter of concern for call center agents. However, if they maintain a balance in their lives by taking adequate shut-eye, eating good diet and exercising, they can work their way towards their desired fitness level.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we take the health of each agent very seriously.  Besides setting up regular medical camps at the office, we also offer them <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/fusion-shares-5-great-habits-to-match-the-lifestyle-of-a-bpo-job.html" target="_blank">tips to maintain a healthy lifestyle</a>.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3>Climb the Corporate Ladder by Cracking the Next IJP</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A large section of the call center workforce is young people. They have this burning desire to prove their worth and climb the corporate ladder. And the best way of moving up in the organization is through internal job posting.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we love ambition, and we wholeheartedly support an agent who wants to move up the corporate ladder.  An agent can opt for our ongoing training sessions to harness their skills and at the same time ask their seniors for advice. And when they get selected in the internal job posting (IJP), we are as happy as they are for their success.</p>
<p>After all these, you must be wondering about our New Year resolution.  Simple, our resolution is to deliver state of the art <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/2014-customer-service-week-6-ways-to-make-deliver-the-best-customer-service.html" target="_blank">customer service</a> throughout the year.</p>
<p>And with that note Fusion wants to wish each of you a Happy and Prosperous New Year 2015!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brand becomes tangible through customer interaction. And customer interaction takes an upsurge with the use of contact centers.</p>
<p>As customer interaction is the primary key to unlock good profits for your business, some questions will follow when you choose a contact center to set your branding strategy-</p>
<ul>
<li>How do contact center heats up your customer interaction?</li>
<li>How can they spread your brand message?</li>
<li>What are the steps adopted by contact centers in branding?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let Fusion brief you the answers to above questions.</p>
<p>Contact centers actually enjoy a powerful position to build and reinforce your brand and help you stay a step ahead from your competitors.</p>
<p>A contact center adds WOW factor in your business and sets a powerful brand identity and highlights what you do best compared to your competitors.</p>
<p>In order to reinforce your brand day in and day out, Fusion keeps brand promise in two popular ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through agents working in our contact center</li>
<li>Through technological support to run the contact center operations</li>
</ul>
<h3>Agents Communicate Your Brand</h3>
<p>Agents at Fusion serve as the frontlines for communicating client’s brand. In order to drive focus on the brand, we employ agent-training program.</p>
<p>In the program, we feed our sales agent with information on the client’s approach in conducting their business, setting <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/is-your-contact-center-tracking-the-right-metrics.html" target="_blank">differentiators</a> against the client’s competitors, thus set a branding strategy.</p>
<p>After we introduce the changes, what follows up?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fusion feels it necessary to keep agents updated with company procedures, competition that the brand faces to communicate effectively with customers. Fusion arms their employees with relevant information to assist agents in quick decision-making in case of any change in the procedures.</li>
<li>Fusion has started reward programs to recognize the right agents in charge of customer interaction, simply keeping a tab on their day-to-day performance. With the use of monitoring tools, we catch up with Fusionites representing brand values of our clients.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contact Center Technology Supports the Brand</h3>
<p>Survey shows that there are five times more chances for a customer to leave a company for the poor experience than for the product quality or price.</p>
<p>Using all probable marketing efforts to drive customers towards contact center is important, since sales representatives can make the interactions fast, easy, personalized and courteous.</p>
<p>Technology helps customers to gel with the highest level of service directing calls to the right agents, implanting channel consistency and transferring customer details at every call.</p>
<p>How we attain the highest level of customer service excellence at Fusion?</p>
<ul>
<li>When customers call, we make sure that he or she connects with the right agent who can deliver what the customer wants. Routing rules identify the customer and directs the call to the best-equipped agent to provide personalized service to customers, leading to first call resolutions. (<a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/is-your-contact-center-tracking-the-right-metrics.html" target="_blank">FCR</a> is the primary ingredient of a stellar customer service.)</li>
<li>We handle customer interaction separately using phone, email, chat or fax. We have a universal queue that considers all these channels equally. Technologies like screen prompt, scripting tools and presence of a unified desktop meets quality standards and reinforces brands messages while interacting with customers.</li>
<li>We have enabled the process of transferring customer details with each call to stop customers from repeating their account numbers or even the call purpose. As repeating is troublesome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Branding is no doubt a hard aspect, but earning it is worthy for your business. Do you know a well-developed and reinforced brand contributes real value to the niche market? The value will help your business enjoy higher stock price, greater gross margin and bottom line savings irrespective of size.</p>
<p>Fusion employs the right agent and the right technology in place to deliver the right kind of customer experience for their client.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we believe that experience matters. Since, experience delivers brand promise with a positive note.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you aspire to become a self-sufficient business owner?</p>
<p>To be self-sufficient is the primary desire of many business owners. Instead of spending money on the outside agencies, business owners prefer to handle their task themselves. They prefer to run their business operations in-house.</p>
<p>This is a good business sense and a speculated step which both small and mid-size businesses adopt. However, there are a number of advantages when it comes to outsourcing certain office tasks. Small and start-up business owners can have a huge benefit by hiring a call answering service.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we have an opportunity to work with industry leaders. Some of these businesses are small but are promising in their services and product bench. We associate with these promising small business owners to offer them quality support.</p>
<p>After the end of the campaigns, a majority of our small business clients notified us that they not only saved their money by opting for our offshore services, but also helped their business grow faster in terms of profits and customer acquisition.</p>
<p>Businesses have started to recognize the value of hiring a call answering service. It’s no more a cup of coffee for big entrepreneurs, even start-ups or small investor can leverage their tasks to offshore call centers.</p>
<h2><i>Advantages Small Business Owners Can Have From Offshore Call Center Services</i></h2>
<p>Saving money through offshore call center service seems counterintuitive. How will an outside agency provide effective service at a low cost in comparison to in-house agents?</p>
<h3>Comparing In-House Agents and an Outsourced Agent</h3>
<p><strong>IN-HOUSE AGENT</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever thought of the hidden cost of hiring an in-house agent? &#8211; You have to pay them salary, have to pay for the set-ups, rent of work-place, equipments, internet connection etc. A lot of money is also spent on training the agents until they are ready to hit the floor.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the agents will be working in-house they will take sick leave, vacations, holidays and worse is that you have to pay them even when they are away from work. You have to consider the situations like turning up late due to heavy traffic on their commuting path or a bad weather. You have to face a threat of untimely quitting, with or without putting a notice. Seeking a suitable replacement or a temporary agent is a hard task.</p>
<p><strong>OUTSOURCED AGENT</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In comparison to an in-house agent, the offshore agents work for much less.</li>
<li>In case of offshore call center services like Fusion BPO, you do not need to spend on training and development.</li>
<li>An offshore call center can provide you with professional customer service 24/7. You do not have to worry about loss of work due to vacations, casual or sick leave, traffic or other variables. It’s the contact center’s headache.  All you need to know is that your customers will get assistance whenever they need with the offshore agents.</li>
<li>No more will the customer service remain tied to the whims of a single person, customers will get a smiling retreat and every issue will get the importance it deserves.</li>
</ol>
<p>Get a quality offshore call center support to have a good impression on your customers, they will be more happy and that too within a small budget.</p>
<h3>Comparing In-house and Offshore Services</h3>
<p><strong>IN-HOUSE SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>Often with in-house customer service, you are going to face the problems like &#8211; power outages, technical difficulties, and natural disasters. You might not stay prepared for such circumstances all the time.</p>
<p>Even if you stay prepared, you may face problems like labor deficiency while managing such situations.</p>
<p><strong>OUTSOURCED SERVICES</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Offshore call centers come in handy in case of power outages, technical difficulties, and natural disasters.  As their job is to ensure that your customers get quality service, they try every possible mean to deliver.</li>
<li>If tornado, a hailstorm, an earthquake or a hurricane affects your business, your customer calls will not go waste. The offshore representatives on your behalf can talk to them and resolve their issues.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, opting for offshore call center services will help you to reduce overhead cost, improve customer service and have rapid business growth.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you joined a BPO job recently? Are you a recent graduate? Then the high pay scale, hip-n-happening work environment and fun-loving colleagues are surely going to make you happy.</p>
<p>Working in a BPO gives you the scope to enjoy a great nightlife with late night parties, pub party, boozing in bars since all these seem to you as the sign of <b>‘<em>good life</em>’</b>. However, the other side should also be considered.</p>
<p>Yes, BPO jobs do have some odd ends, which ultimately make you suffer from health loss. Some common bad effects of a BPO job are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graveyard shift brings on depressions and ill health</li>
<li>Erratic sleeping patterns</li>
<li>Improper diet</li>
<li>Meals consumed at odd hours</li>
</ul>
<p>The results of these bad habits – (are far worse) – <b>feeling old quite early, tired, ill and depressed</b>. Fusion BPO Services has been in the industry since 9 years, and we are savvy enough about the good and bad side of BPO jobs. Through this blog, we want our employees to suit the lifestyle of a BPO job rather than get frenzied over it.</p>
<p>According to the University Of The Philippines’ Population Institute And The International Labor Organization a <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---safework/documents/instructionalmaterial/wcms_178396.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> done in 2010 revealed that half of the BPO workers experience <b>fatigue</b> (54%) and <b>insomnia</b> (47.7%). The situation is similar in every country that has a growing BPO industry. Therefore, we thought to share some cracking ideas to save our workers from the monotony of their job.</p>
<p>What is the solution?  &#8211; To get a balance in your work life and to match with the BPO lifestyle you need to adapt two mantras:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking enough rest</li>
<li>Eating the right food</li>
</ul>
<p>Fusion is going to share five great exciting tips to help the employee agree with the BPO lifestyle. Do you want to explore more? So here we go.</p>
<h3><i>Tip 1: Load Enough Proteins Before You Enter the Graveyard Shift</i></h3>
<p>Which types of food are rich sources of protein? Well, <b>grilled fish, chicken, eggs, tofu, soybean </b>and<b> nuts</b> are highly rich in proteins. Protein gained from foods is converted into amino acids by our body, and thus help to build muscles and blood. Protein saves you from the unnecessary fatigues. Have enough protein from now if you work on a night shift!</p>
<h3><i>Tip 2: Say ‘Yes’ To Carbs</i></h3>
<p>Carbs are not always bad. Your body needs a certain amount of it. Yes, the foods rich in carbohydrate and tryptophan <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/serotonin-boosters/" target="_blank">produce serotonin</a>, a hormone that regulates mood, sleep, learning, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction" target="_blank">vasoconstriction</a> (constriction of blood vessels). <b>Whole grains</b> and <b>fruits</b> are a good source of carbohydrate. You may also try vegetables such as <b>potatoes, parsnips</b>, and <b>beans</b>. For gaining tryptophan, consume <b>cheese, chicken, tofu, soy, sesame, pumpkin seeds</b> and <b>turkey</b>. A diet enriched with carbohydrate and tryptophan will help you to sleep better.</p>
<h3><i>Tip 3: Dinner before 8 PM</i></h3>
<p>Try to finish your dinner by 8PM. This will help you to give some time to your body to digest the food. Since, human science says after 8PM metabolism reduces largely. Therefore, it becomes harder for the body to digest food.</p>
<h3><em> Tip 4: Workout and Exercise</em><b><i></i></b></h3>
<p>Figure out what kind of exercise will suit you. You have different ways to keep your body fit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workout in a gym</li>
<li>Swim few laps in a pool</li>
<li>Yoga sessions</li>
<li>Power yoga</li>
<li>Aerobics</li>
<li>Zumba</li>
<li>Pilates</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the exercise that suits you the best and make it a part of your life. Exercise will let you boost the brainpower, keep off the diseases and ward off mental stress. You will be able to build a positive mindset as <a href="http://www.rd.com/slideshows/8-ways-to-naturally-increase-endorphins/" target="_blank">regular exercise</a> releases endorphins (happy hormones).</p>
<h3><i>Tip 5: A Big ‘No’ to Caffeine and Nicotine</i></h3>
<p>The call center workers have a tendency to drink a lot of coffee in a day. You can have a substitute in that case. Try <b>buttermilk, herbal tea, green tea</b> and <b>basil tea</b>. Green tea has anti-oxidants <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/food-nutrition/facts/antioxidant.htm" target="_blank">that help</a> to neutralize free radicals. It’s good to be a non-smoker, don’t get tempted to smoke. Smoking can ruin your health and can lead to premature aging and early death at a younger age. Try to <a href="http://www.cancer.org/healthy/stayawayfromtobacco/guidetoquittingsmoking/guide-to-quitting-smoking-toc" target="_blank">quit smoking</a>.</p>
<p>Some healthy signs after you quit smoking:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Leaving smoking after a month, the blood circulation and lung-function increases.</i></li>
<li><i>Within 9 months, coughing and shortness of breath decreases.</i></li>
<li><i>Within 1-year heart diseases reduces. </i></li>
<li><i>Within five and ten years, you will avoid the risk of lung cancer.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Fusion is presently having several thousand employees in their graveyard shifts in the four contact center cities – <b>United States, Canada, India </b>and<b> Philippines.</b> We advise our employees to take up these great habits to modify their lifestyle and thus enjoy their BPO job in a relaxed manner.</p>
<p>Make room for the good things to start happening in your life as soon as possible. Balance your work and personal life now! Start following the tips today!!!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often contact centers arrange agent retention campaigns. Do you know why they arrange it? As we know that working in a call center is a tedious job, the agent has high chances to leave the job at every stage.</p>
<p>Since the agent has to handle huge volumes of call throughout the day, so repeating the same act 50 to 75 times irritates the agents. Many people who began their work at the contact center, probably knows that how monotonous is the job.</p>
<p>In eminent contact centers like <em>Fusion</em>, we break up the agent&#8217;s day periodically. Things like agent training and team meetings that associate with different activities all are a part of the daily schedule. However, what else the agents can do in between handling the calls, which do not occur in the specific time.</p>
<p>Fusion knows that happy agents can make the customers happy in return. Boosting up the agent retention is necessary, but how contact center can meet it? Here, we have some of their own ideas to share.</p>
<h3>1) Agent Growth</h3>
<p>You won&#8217;t be satisfied if the customers come to know more about the product and the service offered than your agent. If customer problems get resolved through multiple channels before calling the call center, then no complex issues will be left to resolve.</p>
<p>So make sure that the agents have the proper training to increase their communication skills and have the detailed information to entertain all the abrupt questions coming from the customers.</p>
<h3>2) Use Of Social Media</h3>
<p>We ask our agents to support the customers through the social media platforms on behalf of the company. This helps to liven up their agent’s day and takes the customer service to the target markets.</p>
<p>Social media is the recent craze among the customers and people like to engage themselves through this platform as it is an instant way to communicate. In the beginning of the day, a little of social networking can really escalate the agent’s mood as well as engage in customer satisfaction.</p>
<h3>3) Mingling With The Customer Community</h3>
<p>It is better to ask the agents to mingle with various customer communities via an assigned task. It will not only reduce boredom, but could end up turning idle time into a call evading solution. And it really helps agent to know the customer traits in a better manner. So if they have to handle an irate customer, there would be less chance of getting frustrated.</p>
<h3>4) Back Office Experience</h3>
<p>Customer experience is the biggest concern to start the sales process within a call center. It also helps to ease the back office backlog, improve the customer experience and offer various back-office tasks like &#8211; application processing, fax communications, and processing returns.</p>
<h3>5) The Opportunity To Welcome A Call Effectively</h3>
<p>Your agent must get the opportunity to take the customer call without any interruption and begin warm customer relationships. For that, we train them with creative ideas to greet the customers, so that even irate customers feel keen to carry on with the conversation.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we try to make our call center a better place to work for our agents. As the time is tight, we have to stick to the service rules. High attrition rate and the low agent engagement is not the norm. One has options to challenge the accepted methods during the intraday management.</p>
<p>In spite of all the tactics, we follow, it is generally seen that staffing and call volume don&#8217;t quite match up. 85% tenancy equates to 17 hours of idle time a month. Therefore, in such cases we have seen that automating intraday management helps to re-purpose the time so that our agents can take a break from calls to improve customer experience, contact center productivity and agent retention.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is never a better time to train the contact center staff.</p>
<p>You will come across agent training tips in the contact center websites and expert comments from the various call center managers. However, all stresses on the key factor – <i>“</i><i><strong>training of employees is a key point for any organization</strong>.”</i></p>
<p>Initial training of the agents on all equipments consist of different aspects of soft skills like &#8211; communication, empathy, and the ability to convey the message in a clear and understandable way to the client.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the contact center supervisors need to initiate training focused on the product issues. As the clients, who come to outsource their business need to know, that the contact center will provide them with proper customer support and sales of their products and services.</p>
<p>Knowing this theory is not going to win bigger opportunities for you. Rather, you have to speculate measures and make the training sessions effective.</p>
<p>Fusion like other contact center services includes the practice in training and has training labs to stimulate the learners. The call center needs a set of tools to give an opportunity to the advisor to interact with the agents properly and simulate them for future processes. If the agents fail to achieve the quality standards and operational levels, then the advisor must continue with the training sessions.</p>
<p>The majority of contact center company is of the opinion that successful customer relationship lies in training and motivating their team.</p>
<h3><i>Training Your Agent with Appropriate Contact Center Technology</i><b><i> </i></b></h3>
<p>When we talk about agent training in the contact center field, we have to carry a statistic in our hand. The wide quoted statistics says that, 20% of the people remember what they hear, 30% of what they see. Combining these two aspects, the ratio becomes 50%.</p>
<p>Making people aware of what they need to do, along with retention of information, scales up to 70% and more. Studies show that people learn fast when they participate in an activity.</p>
<p>Call centers must stress on a motto while they take on to train their agents – “each <i>day will be a better day than the previous,”</i> to set confidence and zeal among their agents. Weekly routine sessions are a constant ritual that is going to give agents a chance to show where they are heading. It will also help them to move the operating levers and find a suitable path for effective customer support.</p>
<p>We have recognized that agent training takes time, and time costs money. However, we have developed ways of training that can be delivered in the workplace using the idle time.</p>
<p><b><i>Making the Agents Remember What They Need to Say</i></b> &#8211; set this trend in your contact center to leverage befitting services to customers and clients. Deploy live, call quality monitoring and phrase to make your agents well equipped.</p>
<p>The adoption of such a solution would allow agents to enjoy the benefit collectively and have their own private mentor and trainer sitting on their shoulder. Thus, agent will be able to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>What they must say to the customers</li>
<li>What they forgot to say to the customers</li>
<li>Where they are wrong in their approach</li>
<li>Whether they were speaking too loud or too soft, too fast or too slow</li>
</ul>
<p>All the agents need to aim for  customer happiness and not just for customer satisfaction at the end of every call. Thus, enabling a flexible agent training campaign is must for all the major call center companies.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, call center trend won’t die. Customers will keep on calling or receiving the phone, as it is the great media of contact.</p>
<p>There are so many reasons for the consumers to contact the companies and there is no reason to think that phone is dead. Consumers in this era prefer to get the support over the phone to another method of contacts. For this reason, the contact centers will, not die away any time soon.</p>
<p>Let us check out the latest survey that shows phone support is the most effective one:</p>
<p>The question asked in the survey was: <b><i>Which Method Do You Prefer To Contact with the Customer Service Call Centers?</i></b></p>

</table>
<p>If you watch the chart carefully, you will find that telephonic conversation is still in huge demand over other new media. Even in United States, people prefer to converse over the online phone beside the telephonic conversation for their business transactions.</p>
<p>We at <em>Fusion</em> provide excellent customer support over the telephone, to maintain the top-notch client-customer relationship. A top-notch client-customer relationship is the hidden reason for successful business. Therefore, you must have it.</p>
<p>Fusion is a multichannel contact center, but phone support is the most effective if we compare to other channels. We have assessed that 72% of our customers are satisfied with the telephonic interaction. That too the service provided by the agents and the 12% of them are satisfied with self-service phone.</p>
<p>With the advancement in the technology, the call center structure has changed at a larger scale. Traditional call centers have to maintain plenty of staff on-hand to handle the incoming calls for customer service issues and queries.</p>
<p>The deployment of advanced call center technologies has made different business gain impetus in their niche. Presently 3.5 million of agents are working with US call centers. If we look into the number of inbound calls transacted over the year on average, it sums up to 45.4 billion and it costs $5.90 per calls.</p>
<h3>Futuristic Call Center at a Glance</h3>
<p>The number of agents working at today’s call center is huge. However, the concentration of the female population is little larger than the male population. Around 71% of the agents are female and 29% are male. As females are excellent at retaining tonal quality, along with the hospitality, which is essential for customer service.</p>
<p>Inbound calls are still having a large percentage in the call center queue. It is around 79% and the outbound calls are around 21%.</p>
<p>The number of customers served through the inbound and outbound calls is divided in two approaches: mass market and business customers. The percentage of mass-market customer is 75% and the business customers served are 25%.</p>
<p>The call center services are generally of three types: <em>customer service</em>, <em>sales only</em> and <em>sales plus</em> service. With the advent of higher technologies, the percentage of each service is categorized in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Providing customer service- 49%</i></li>
<li><i>Providing sales only- 21%             </i></li>
<li><i>Providing sale and service- 30%</i></li>
</ul>
<p>To stay ahead in this competitive market, get the right outsourcing partner. As call center won’t die but their efficiency will be in turn increasing at a rapid speed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>“Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success.” (Henry Ford)</i></p>
<p>This is the perfect quote to cherish the team building aspect in every contact centers. The contact centers generally spend their days interacting with the customers. Therefore, it is quite easy for them to feel isolated.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Can team-building activities help the contact centers? </i></li>
<li><i>Will the team building give a better share of experience to the customers? </i></li>
<li><i>Will the contact center rise to the challenge?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>To answer all these questions a contact center manager is the best person. However, before that we have to know whether the mangers are willing to spend money on team building. If not, should they?</p>
<p>Yes, they should spend their money on team building.  It is essential to have at-home staff to make those people feel that they are essential part of the organization. You can effectively invest in your staff yet keep the cost down to a level.</p>
<p>The research on a global level has shown that employees engage more when they understand the company&#8217;s mission. They have the skills and the training that they need to succeed and give the desired feedback that the company expects to get from them.</p>
<p>In other words, team building can be described as the empty set of off-sites that will bring strong improvement in the contact center performance. Temkin Group <i>(Customer Service and Research Company) </i>is of the opinion that the contact centers teams must do the periodic hurdles, short meetings with the team prior to review the performance and the customer feedback data. In order to stress on the fact how they can improve the team.</p>
<p>These meetings should wish agents KUDOS! who performs well and let them share how they have performed. Incorporate the major team-building exercises in the contact centers and she believes in such activities to make a difference in the agent morale as well as foster a sense of collegiality among the contact center agents.</p>
<p>To make the T.E.A.M successful follow up these three tips:</p>
<h3><b> </b>Holding Contests</h3>
<p>If a large financial institution was running a balance transfer campaign, they should have organized a team contest to deliver the most balance transfers. Go a step further to foster the services from the human angle. You can help the contest of organizing themes, like which team can decorate their office space the best like with the summer theme, winter theme, Halloween, Easter etc.</p>
<h3>Agent Mentors</h3>
<p>We at Fusion have strongly implemented this measure, to build up the team spirit and get the agents talk about the part of the job that leads them to trouble. If some of the agents have a problem with the call handling time, Fusion employs a mentor for them in order to provide them with adequate help. Tying an incentive will help the agents to improve the average handle time. The incentive does not mean that it has to be monetary, rather you can avail them with good gift vouchers or certificates of excellence.</p>
<p>Being the industry leader Fusion thinks that team element comes through peer mentoring. They use expert agents in their contact centers and foster the team building necessity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Also read: <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-boost-up-the-employee-happiness-meter.html">Contact Center Boost up the Employee Happiness Meter</a></p></blockquote>
<h3>Connecting Business to Contact Centers</h3>
<p>You can take the team to field trips in order to make them know about the business, and let the customers know vividly what is actually happening with their payments. Managers can foster in the mind of the agent that they are part of the business rather than just the contact center.</p>
<p>There are contact center, which deploys games to drive the individual and team behavior. Well, this system can actually help, but you have to make sure that they match up with the contact center goals and the desired behavior.</p>
<p>Just <em>calling a customer and promoting new services</em> is no longer going to keep the agents active. Get them into the feeling &#8211; that they are also a vivid part of the entire transaction, business and the contact center.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where do you see yourself in 5 years from now? – A common but seemingly unnerving question from the interviewer. How can one correctly predict his future? And yet having a vision, a goal and prudence is essential. The same thing applies for outsourcing business. No one can predict what the future has in store for the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-india-is-taking-business-to-the-next-level.html">global outsourcing industry</a>, but one can surely have an idea –</p>
<p>As per the outsourcing experts, over the period next 5 years &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Offshore vendors will differentiate themselves more depending on service offered and industry verticals served. To be in the market, they need to demonstrate specific skills and knowledge and not just cost arbitrage.</li>
<li>Certain industries like retail, education and travel in continue to lean heavily on outsourcing while others may not significantly increase their offshore functions.</li>
<li>Non-voice contact centers will increasingly be performed offshore and its great will be significantly higher than the low growth experienced in the total voice sector.</li>
<li>Clients of outsourced vendors will have a better idea of what works offshore and what does not. This will reflect in their outsourcing pattern.</li>
<li>Offshore remote &#8211; based agents will not rise significantly. But offshore call centers that focus on cold call sales, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/life-insurance-appointment-setting-service-quality-life-insurance-leads.html">appointment setting</a>, customer support and IT support will keep thriving.</li>
<li>Offshore vendors will be the main beneficiary of non-voice contact center activity including email and chat support, order processing, social media communications, email marketing etc.</li>
<li>India and The Philippines will continue to be the main benefactor of global outsourcing industry.</li>
<li>Low-end outbound activity will continue to be a strong area of growth for offshore</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, as <a href="http://www.call-centres.com/articles/?p=39" target="_blank">Rob O’Malley</a> is right to point out, there is no longer a place for weak offshore vendors in the next 5 years. Only those who are able to differentiate services will remain in business in the long run. Having a track record of offering services specific to different industry verticals, <em>Fusion </em>strongly believes that to be in business, an outsourcing vendor needs to stress more on specialized services, agent training and cost handling.</p>
<p>Fusion is also of the opinion that in another 5 years, <a href="http://www.sociableblog.com/2013/01/28/how-to-choose-the-right-cloud-for-your-business/" target="_blank">cloud-based systems</a> will dominate the call center industry. Everything from customer data to telephony software will be available on cloud, giving call centers greater flexibility and savings. Since Fusion has contact centers in US, Canada, India and the Philippines, It will also be easy for them to manage the operations through cloud.</p>
<p>In other words, 5 years from now, intelligent call centers that can adapt to ever-changing technology, customized requirements of their clients and their customers (who will be reaching the call centers through various channels including telephone, chat, email, social network etc.), will continue to operate. This vision has lead Fusion to adapt some important changes in their operational strategies. It plans to give special attention on the following areas.</p>
<h3>Intelligent call routing</h3>
<p>As a matter of fact, social media and web 2.0 channels have over 50% penetration in different contact center operations while around 25% smartphone users use internet on phone, the role of a contact center is changing rapidly. And to adapt to such changes, every contact center needs a <a href="http://unified-communications.tmcnet.com/topics/unified-communications/articles/322922-uc-expansion-feeds-off-byod-growth.htm" target="_blank">BYOD</a> intelligent call routing based on the following –</p>
<ul>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Type of request</li>
<li>Communication channels or device</li>
</ul>
<p>This will essentially reduce the call transfer by 1-2 minutes per call and thus will help offer better service.</p>
<h3>Role of Agents</h3>
<p>Owing to various needs of the customers, the role of agents will also change. They need to be</p>
<ul>
<li>Product or service specialist</li>
<li>Multilingual</li>
<li>Expert in social engagement and response</li>
<li>Expert in Conflict resolution and crisis resolution</li>
<li>Specialist in cross selling and up selling</li>
</ul>
<p>Training agents to handle all kind of issues and on specialized services can help clients to get better service for their customers. Having <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/multilingual-call-center.html">multilingual</a> and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/french-call-center.html">French-speaking agents</a> on board, Fusion will get the maximum benefit of an intelligent routing system.</p>
<h3>Broadening Of Social Media, Web and Email Support</h3>
<p>With customers using different communication channels, the contact centers too needs to <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/social-customer-services-personalize-customer-support.html">broaden its social media and web support</a> approach. As non-voice operations are going to have a bigger share of contact center operations, Fusion is stressing on the non-voice services as well.</p>
<h3>Specialization to Cater to Different Industry Verticals</h3>
<p>Fusion has a long experience in offering customize services specific to different industry verticals. Travel (including <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/travel_tourism.html">Timeshare</a>), education, financial services and retail are some of the verticals that the company caters to.</p>
<p>Apart from these, Fusion also recommends maintaining a customer-centric approach in the work culture. To achieve this, one needs to-</p>
<ul>
<li>Adapt new technologies</li>
<li>Create a proper data management ecosystem and use right person at the right place on right time.</li>
<li>Empower agents to offer unique user experience</li>
<li>Use new channels to offer a great customer service.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a contact center can adapt these changes, they can emerge as the next-gen contact center that is here to stay.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="&quot;lightbox&quot;&quot;" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/jscreationzs2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4592" title="Manila call center" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/jscreationzs2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/jscreationzs2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/jscreationzs2.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>One of the reasons why the call center companies in Manila are considered to be the first choice of the business enterprises even from half way across the globe is the strong work culture prevailing all throughout the Metro Manila region. The educational qualification of the agents and the strict training session has made definite contributions in this regard. Also it is the need of the agents to prove their worth in order to stick on because they do not really have any other source of income in the country makes them regular and excellent at their work.</p>
<p>No matter what the weather condition is like which is pretty bad during the monsoon and the tropical cyclones, the <strong><a title="Manila call center" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/">Manila call center</a></strong> agents are always available. The customers from all over the world can reach them anytime for any issue and most importantly at any hour of the day. Even on holidays, festive or holiday seasons there would be someone or the other to attend to the customer calls and to keep the business marketing campaigns going.</p>
<p>It is this responsible character of the call center agents from Manila and their commitment towards the work assigned to them makes them the ideal off-role employees for the contemporary businesses.
