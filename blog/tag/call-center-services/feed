								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contact centers today stress on the use of hosted technologies for their call centers. In 2012, hosted solutions have gained prominence over other technologies. A hosted contact center solution is the ‘network-based’ service where a service provider owns and operates a contact center technology platform.</p>
<p>Since the inception, say about 15 years ago, hosted contact center solutions use to customize services to Small-to-Medium Businesses (SMBs). They were able to provide scaled-down features in exchange for convenience and low cost.</p>
<p>We do have cloud based contact center solution, but a new chapter has begun with the launch of better hosted offerings that have redefined the value proposition.</p>
<p>Over the years, vast differentiators have changed the character of hosted contact center technologies. They have introduced added features like the <a class="zem_slink" title="Total cost of ownership" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">total-cost-of ownership</a>, up-front investment, architecture and scale. It was in the early 2000s that the SMBs faced difficulty in choosing the right contact center technologies. At that time, <a class="zem_slink" title="Business telephone system" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_telephone_system" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">PBX</a> or premise-based solutions were a preferred choice. In 2005, cloud-based services do excelled above others, and the international market saw a immediate increase in sales.</p>
<p>Whereas the hosted solutions improved with advanced features like &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Disaster Recovery</li>
<li>Integration of At-Home or Remote Agents</li>
<li>Automatic Upgrades</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these advantages, the function and the control portfolio remain far behind the premise-based options.</p>
<p>Now in 2013, business interest and supplier innovation combined to produce a significant growth in the Hosted services. A research done by <a href="http://www.contactbabel.com/pdfs/sep2012/Inner_Circle_Guide_CCC_UK.pdf" target="_blank">Contactbabel</a>, further confirms <a class="zem_slink" title="Automatic call distributor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_call_distributor" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">ACD</a> has reached more than $330 million in 2010 and are expected to grow at a percentage of 13.2% to achieve $795.3 million by 2017. The significant growth is the biggest hinder for the success of hosted contact center solutions.</p>
<p>However, with the congregation of exclusive features, hosted solutions are providing 4 substantial benefits to the contact center owners and their clients. Even at Fusion, we use hosted solutions to promote advanced solution for our small and medium sized business clients.</p>
<p>4 hosted contact center features that will give you an edge over the competitors include:</p>
<p><strong>1. Featured Functions</strong></p>
<p>The hosted service provider offers unified agent desktop that allows agents to navigate billing systems, knowledge bases, and numerous products easily. The same way also allows utilizing faster, and flexible tools to determine pacing, set up campaigns, monitor agents and maximize the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/call-center-outsourcing-become-more-efficient.html">call center efficiency</a>. They also share the rich data capturing and reporting features to track activities in real-time.</p>
<p><strong>2. Continuous Business Flow</strong></p>
<p>Contact center owners often face the problem of data loss and that a basic catastrophe. Even we at Fusion go through such situations as we have to maintain a large customer database. For the SMBs   data loss and consumer privacy are common concerns, so at Fusion we do handle them carefully. A hosted service with the right vendor can have a stable business flow.</p>
<p><strong>3. Flexibility</strong></p>
<p>The primary advantage of the hosted solutions is the flexibility, which allows users to meet the changing needs. As the global contact center companies are becoming fragmented and location-agonistic, business is able to meet the diverging work flow model.</p>
<p><strong>4. Hosted-to-Premise Migration</strong></p>
<p>This is the significant potential shift in the contact center performance. Variety of changes is going to happen, and for that, companies must adopt hosted services to be cost-worthy, provide ongoing customer care, etc. Hosted contact center is slowly evolving as an out-of-the-box tool, to produce a sophisticated, enterprise-ready solution. Their feature functionality and flexibility are adding the future enhancements.</p>

This technology enables the agents to use many applications within an incoming call from a customer. When a unified desktop interface is used at the call centers, it implies that the call handling and training times are considerably reduced, and there is also the elimination of typo errors.</p>
<p>There are several benefits that unified desktop interface can provide the agents for making their tasks easier. The calls received can be classified according to the frequency, the data required for the completion of calls or tasks, and for the purpose of creating unified dashboard views for the required data. With the help of this interface, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/services.html"><strong>call center services</strong></a> are able to update data in several applications simultaneously; this is done by enabling data to be inserted into several applications with just a single click.</p>
<p>Simple automations are added for streamlining the navigation. This enables the agents to extract the data they want to without navigating the complex applications. When the desktop is made to do a lot of tasks, it means that the need for offering agent training is considerably reduced in call centers India. Through automation at the call center services, it is possible for the managers to enforce the execution of important tasks rather than expect the agents follow the already established processes. Business automation through the unified desktop interface can make business tasks simpler, faster and offer high levels of effectiveness.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contemporary business enterprises are benefited from the expert assistance of Manila BPO companies.

<p>Appointing a <strong>call center</strong> service provider is advantageous. The business expenses on customer servicing is considerably reduced. If the option of outsourcing would not have been there, the entrepreneurs would have to make huge capital investments. Businesses should keep one thing in mind that the in-house resources are not sufficient to meet the requirements of the end users. If the business has to handle customer service department on their own they need to make fresh recruitments and at the same time invest on infrastructure build- up.</p>
<p>Along with the cost advantage and quality assurance, <strong><a title="call center services" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/services.html">call center services</a></strong> in Manila ensure that the customer queries and concerns are attended on time. No matter at what hour of the day, the end users call the business for help, call center companies in Manila will always be there to attend to each and every customer call.</p>

Only reputed call centers strictly believe in the principle of quality and absolute client satisfaction; it must be noted that without customer satisfaction, it is not possible for a business to reach new heights.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="&quot;lightbox&quot;&quot;" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/profit.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4524" title="call center services" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/profit.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a>The call center industry started when the business enterprises felt the urgency to outsource their customer care services. Given the work load the business enterprises had to face suddenly on the eve of globalization it became pretty much impossible to handle the innumerable customer issues on their own.  But the customer care department cannot be neglected if the existing customers were to be retained and newer ones were to be roped in. This is the reason why <strong><a title="call center services" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/services.html">call center services</a></strong> assumed so much importance in conducting the business affairs better.</p>
<p>It is the incredible amount of success that these inbound call center companies have registered in customer care services that encouraged them to expand their scope of services. Now these companies even assist in marketing and advertising of the business products or services. And they are doing a good in fact a great job. Qualified lead generation has become so much easier after these specialized firms have taken up the responsibility on behalf of the business houses.</p>
<p>Not only expansion but these business houses have also specialized in various fields. For instance, answering service has for long been the forte of the call center companies. Handling business calls on behalf of the business was their primary responsibility. But the service based industries were reluctant to outsource. But now with the answering service staffs specializing in medical, legal, financial and other areas, the service based businesses can also reap the benefits of outsourcing.</p>
<p>Thus the expansion and the specialization of the call center services is a good news for the business enterprises indeed.</p>
