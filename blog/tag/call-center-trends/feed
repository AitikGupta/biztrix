								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One month into 2015 and the call center industry is already undergoing a drastic change. Many call centers have implemented new policies and procedures to maximize their performance in the future.</p>
<p>The focus of these changes includes &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving customer satisfaction</li>
<li>Increasing agent productivity</li>
<li>Reducing overhead</li>
</ul>
<p>So what’s new in 2015?</p>
<p>This year there is increased emphasis on call center technologies that help businesses meet the needs and preferences of the customers. There are quite a few things changing in the call center domain with these goals in mind. Want to know more about these changes?</p>
<p>Follow these cool call center trends of 2015.</p>
<h3>Call centers are now offering self-service systems along with agent support</h3>
<p>The new age customers are far more tech-savvy than their predecessors. A large section of these customers prefers self-service over waiting in a queue to get an assisted customer support. In fact, automated service has become the in thing as it helps customers in resolving common queries.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-service also bodes well for the call centers too. With <a href="https://fonolo.com/blog/2013/04/should-your-call-center-be-using-self-service/">self-service</a> in the place agents no longer have to provide solutions to easy-to-fix issues and as a result they can dedicate their time to complex queries and disgruntled callers.</p>
<p>Also, due to self-service facility the call queue shortens considerably leading to quicker resolution of the problems. Thus, self-service can improve customer satisfaction as well as agent productivity. This way, self service offers a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/changing-scenario-customer-support-channels-2015-kishore-saraogi">win-win situation for the call center and the customer</a>.</p>
<h3>Call centers are going Multichannel to reach customers across different communication platforms<strong>.</strong></h3>
<p>Call centers today do not stick to just phone calls to interact with the callers. Today there are more communication channels such as chats, video calls, mobile apps and social media have become powerful mediums to communicate with the customer and to resolve their issues.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/collaboration/unified-communications/net_business_benefit0900aecd8073dd1e.html">Multi-channel communication</a> offers callers the freedom of using any communication platform. A large number of callers today do not like waiting in queues to talk to an agent. So they prefer chat or any other ways to reach a call center. In most cases, they choose their preferred medium based on their location and convenience.</p>
<p>This in turn reduces complaints and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/can-contact-centers-eliminate-call-holding-time.html">increases customer satisfaction</a> and agent efficiency.</p>
<h3>Better use of cloud storage.</h3>
<p>In this era of cutting edge technology, information sharing, and storage has become all the easier, thanks to cloud storage.  It is not only convenient for the customers but also for the call center as well.</p>
<p>Cloud storage lowers their overhead by eradicating the need for large IT departments and servers that need huge space and a constant supply of electricity.</p>
<p>Cloud storage is especially beneficial for a multi-location call center and virtual call center.  Apart from that <a href="http://www.vocalcom.com/en/contact-center-software/the-growing-adoption-of-cloud-storage-over-data-centers-316640/">cloud storage</a> can also offer data safety in case of any disaster.</p>
<h3>Superior identification and verification processes</h3>
<p>Even today, a typical identification and verification process takes a large chunk of call time – now that is a very long procedure.  To reduce this time businesses are streamlining their call centers and equipping the verification process using improved technology.</p>
<p>This year, call centers are using biometric technology to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gartnergroup/2014/06/18/preventing-fraud-in-the-call-center-with-phone-printing-and-voice-biometrics/">identify customers</a>.  A customer can use the fingerprint scanner on mobile app and voice identification on phone calls for identifying themselves.</p>
<p>This will ensure the security of customer data and at the same time allow companies more time to resolve customers’ inquiries.</p>
<h3>More dependence on real-time metrics and agent reports</h3>
<p>The customers today are more demanding. On one hand they demand quick resolution of their problems on the other they long for personalized service.  The business who can strike a balance between the both ultimately wins the customers over.</p>
<p>Thankfully, today it is a lot easier to find out a customer’s likes, dislikes, relationships, and habits.  So, an advanced metrics can be created and used in every sphere.</p>
<p>By incorporating the advanced <a href="http://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/searchCRM/downloads/metrics-PDF_revised.pdf">metrics</a> into a call center, a business can enjoy greater insight into their clients.  Using the real-time analytics call centers can direct a particular call to the agents who can handle them.</p>
<p>This will ensure proper utilization of agent’s skills which will lead to better agent productivity and improved caller satisfaction. Using advanced metrics it is also possible to point out the weakness of an agent. This will also allow the company to re-train this agent on that specific part.</p>
<p>Implementing these practices into daily call center practice can prepare a call center for the next generation of tech-savvy customers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b><i>¡hola! | </i></b><b><i>Hej! | </i></b><b><i>Ciao! | </i></b><b><i>Bonjour! | </i></b><b><i>Aloha!</i></b></p>
<p>These are the simple lingos for saying “<em>HELLO</em>” in Spanish, Swedish, Italian, French, and Hawaiian respectively.</p>
<p>In what language does your customer speak? Are you able to give them a multilingual support? What you choose to help customer get your service in their native tongue? – Outsourcing or in sourcing?</p>
<p>Preferable pick at present is Outsourcing, but why all businesses choose it? Does it provide a competitive edge to your business?</p>
<h3>Rising Demand of Multilingual Call Centers</h3>
<p>Global population indicator shows that the countries today have a mixed-culture everywhere. Mixed-culture doth bring in people, speaking in more than one language within a small area.</p>
<p>We know that the target market for different products and services keeps on changing so as the people and their native tongue. Your business needs to expand with multi-country clients where call volumes in some languages are very low.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is impossible for companies to maintain an in-house multilingual customer service as it demands trained staff and expensive equipments. Thus, companies prefer to outsource.</p>
<p>What can a multilingual outsourcing provider do? &#8211; Multilingual call center outsourcing of today helps businesses to reach out to the national markets with the use of agents speaking in the native tongue.</p>
<h3>Multilingual Service @Fusion BPO</h3>
<p>Speaking of multilingual call centers, at Fusion BPO, multilingual support is a familiar call center jargon. We have been providing clientele <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/multilingual-call-center.html" target="_blank">support in multiple languages</a> in order to meet different business needs. We have been tailoring flexible solution to our client’s multilingual needs whether they ask for one-off marketing campaigns or want a fully outsourced customer support.</p>
<p>How is it possible for Fusion to maintain this thread of <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/can-contact-centers-eliminate-call-holding-time.html" target="_blank">multi-channel</a> call center communication for such a long time? Handling multilingual call is simple, but Fusionites focuses on five important trends that helps global call centers to gain an edge over the competitors.</p>
<p>Let us get into the discussion.</p>
<h3>Trend 1: Appointing Specialists to Handle the Multilingual Calls</h3>
<p>Clients who outsource their business want to view a perfect gradient in their profit summary at the end of every month. Handling bilingual or multilingual calls was beyond their reach, which made them reach us.</p>
<p><strong>How do we help businesses?</strong></p>
<p>&#8211;  To meet the desired client satisfaction level we appoint specialists trained in multiple languages. This is our core competency that gives us the ability to manage customers efficiently despite the language barrier.</p>
<h3>Trend 2: Keeping an Eye on the Call Quality</h3>
<p>Simply reaching out to the customers speaking in their native tongue is not going to bring business.</p>
<p><strong>How do we help businesses?</strong></p>
<p>&#8211;   As a multilingual call center, we keep a strict eye on the call quality. We use quality systems to monitor our agent’s performance and measure the leads in a fixed interval. We make sure that the agents keep on feeding what they learn during their ongoing training or coaching.</p>
<h3>Trend 3: Flexible Call Pricing</h3>
<p>Cost reduction is the foremost reasons that make businesses outsource their work. Multilingual call centers are not exception.</p>
<p>To maintain an in-house call center B2B marketers have to invest huge capital to install equipments, phone-lines, technology such as voice, e-mail, web handling, CRM and have to manage recruitment &amp; training across multiple languages.</p>
<p><strong>How do we help businesses?</strong></p>
<p>&#8211;  B2B marketers outsource their campaigns at global BPOs like Fusion as they do it at half the price compared to an in-house call center. Our clients can feel the best value for money against their campaigns outsourced to us.</p>
<h3>Trend 4: Can Reach Target Market Faster Than In-House Teams</h3>
<p>We live in a fast moving world. Most of the International brands with whom Fusion works want to reach their target market at a faster pace. As the market faces stiff competition every day, B2B and B2C business owners want to stay one-step ahead of their opponents.</p>
<p><strong>How do we help businesses?</strong></p>
<p>&#8211;  Being a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/speak-global-motto-of-outsourcing-contact-centers.html" target="_blank">reliable multilingual call center</a>, Fusion trains their agents and initiates the service within few weeks. We have enough resource and technological advancements to support our client&#8217;s niche at any occasion.</p>
<h3>Trend 5: Flexible Services to B2B and B2C Client in Peak Seasons</h3>
<p>Often our B2B or B2C partners make queries on the flexibility of outsourced services that can help them to handle seasonal peaks efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>How do we help businesses?</strong></p>
<p>&#8211;  Fusionites have the capability to handle multiple products in multiple languages (often from different clients) at short notice during unexpected peaks. We retain the ongoing product training, besides running the campaign and keeping aside a pool of talent as backup for seasonal peaks.</p>
<p>These five trends are some of the evaluation criteria that a global multilingual call center must preserve when clients choose them as outsourcing partners. Fusionites are no exception. We stand prominent among other because &#8211; <i>Of the little change we have brought in the way we work, think about things that are of second nature to others and learn as the campaigns moves along.</i></p>
