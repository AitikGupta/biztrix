<p>Chatbots have been on the rise since a couple of years and
have already gained popularity. Chatbots can help businesses interact with
their customers and prospects in a new way using messaging apps, the latest
technology, and Artificial Intelligence. </p>



<h2>What is a Chatbot?</h2>



<p>A chatbot is a service that can interact with you just like a real person. Powered by rules and  Artificial Intelligence, chatbots are programmed to simulate a real conversation with users through a chat interface. They are based on machine learning to imitate human conversation and react to service requests.</p>



<p>AI helps them learn the language, human tone, and behavior with every interaction, which in turn helps them to be more intelligent and serve the users better. </p>



<p>For a better understanding of how chatbots can contribute to
your business, let us find the top 7 benefits of chatbots:</p>



<h2>1. Being Present on Messaging Platforms</h2>



<p>Today messaging applications have more users than social
media network. And as customers today think that chat is a convenient and
faster way to interact with a business, businesses today have the chance to
reach more audience via chatbots while staying trendy.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The Majority of smartphone users today do not want to
download new apps. So, businesses can integrate their chatbot in one of the
popular platforms that the customers use on a daily basis such as &#8211; Facebook,
Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. It will also save you time and money. </p>



<h2>2. Improved Customer Service</h2>



<h4>A. Extensive Customer Assistance</h4>



<p>According to a <a href="https://econsultancy.com/83-of-online-shoppers-need-support-to-complete-a-purchase-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">survey</a>, 83% of online shoppers want assistance during shopping. So, your customers may need assistance at any time. Additionally, shoppers may also face navigation issues, or have queries about registration, payment, checkout, and delivery or about the product itself.</p>



<p>In such situations, chatbots can provide real-time assistance through interactive communication over text and voice. They can also provide customers with important relevant information from knowledge base, blogs, tutorial videos and so on.</p>



<h4>B. Always-Available Customer Support</h4>



<p>A great 24/7 customer service has a positive impact on customer satisfaction. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">Chatbots can help you improve the customer support</a> process by quickly giving automated answers to repetitive questions immediately and forwarding the complex ones to a human agent.</p>



<p>Apart from that, chatbots allow businesses to attend more queries at the same time, allowing companies to scale up their operation to new markets globally.</p>



<h4>C. Proactive Customer Interaction</h4>



<p>Companies can also use chatbots to start <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/proactive-customer-service-and-how-to-start-practicing-it.html">proactive customer interactions</a> regarding any issue, any time of the day. This will make your customers feel that your brand cares for them on a 24/7 basis. This can help improve your brand perception in the long run.</p>

<h2>3. Increased Customer Engagement</h2>



<p>Chatbots can be a great tool for customer engagement.
Chatbots can provide the customers with a specific slice of information and
lead the interaction based on the user input at that time.&nbsp; This way, chatbots never provides a dull
interaction with irrelevant and useless information resulting in better
engagement. </p>



<h2>4. Monitoring Consumer Data and Gaining Insights</h2>



<p>Businesses can make changes in their service/products based on the feedback chatbots collect through simple questions. As chatbots are also capable of tracking purchasing patterns and consumer behavior by monitoring user data, they can also help a company to decide marketing strategies.</p>



<p>Companies can use chatbots to track consumer request and responses, predict responses based on the language and direct the chatbot to suggest an alternative product or service. </p>



<h2>5. Cost Savings</h2>

Businesses today can <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="choose from ready-made applications (opens in a new tab)">choose from ready-made applications</a> developed by Facebook, Microsoft, and other IT giants.</p>



<p>Being automated solutions, chatbots can handle many customers at once, saving employee costs and eliminating the scope for human errors. Finally, as customers can access chatbots easily within seconds and interact immediately, the cost of user acquisition also comes down.</p>

<p>While voice remains the number one channel for interaction
between business and its customers, the new age customers today are more
inclined to solve the basic customer service issues by themselves.&nbsp; And for that reason, businesses today are
adding self-service to their customer service channels. Self-service can not
only help customers to save time but also can help businesses boost customer
experience and drive customer loyalty. </p>



<p>These are five types of customer self-service a business can
introduce to boost your customer experience.</p>



<h3>1. Customer Self-service Portals</h3>



<p>If you have customers around the clock, you must have a team
of customer service representatives who can give support 24/7 support around
the world. If you do not have such facility and operate limited hours, a large
section of your customers will have a hard time reaching you. Also, the younger
tech-savvy crowd will definitely look for their answers online even before
reaching your customer service.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Rather than leaving your customer without support from your end, you can invest in a customer self-service portal that contains answers to the most common queries, instruction for basic fixes and a few others that a customer can easily resolve.</p>



<p>Using this portal, a customer can get answers to their basic queries and explore the knowledge base for further details during the non-operational hours. This also allows them to bypass the calling queue and get their answer from your end at their own time and pace. </p>



<p>An additional perk?&nbsp;
The self-service portal can significantly decrease your customer service
costs!</p>



<h3>2. Mobile</h3>



<p>Today most people browse the internet from their smartphone.
Scratch that, people today do almost everything on their smartphone – it’s
easy, it’s convenient and a powerful tool that fits in your pocket.</p>



<p>A mobile app or mobile version of your site can prove to be
beneficial as a self-service tool. However, make sure to make the mobile
version of site user-friendly so that your customers can easily navigate
through the site to find the answers they are looking for.</p>



<p>You can also build a user-friendly app that offers push
notifications and updated features that help you keep the customers updated
about the company and its service updates.</p>



<h3>3. Chatbots and AI</h3>



<p>Live chatbots can offer a great customer experience. With
the help of AI, chatbots can answer customer queries in a matter of seconds.
chatbots can help customers by answering their queries, assisting them, and
even helping them with booking and sales. With live chatbots, finding answers to
your queries have become easier than ever. </p>



<p>Live chatbots are a great way to help confused customers.
Many company sites offer a popup chat window that appears after a certain
period of time spent on the website. These bots have the capability to guide
the customer to the answers they are looking for. Even when they do not have
answers, they can point the customers in the right direction. These chatbots
are also a great way to show that your company cares for its customers and CX.</p>



<h3>4. Kiosks</h3>



<p>A kiosk can be good for short, specific tasks, such as
finding an item in a physical store or checking the price. Self-checkout kiosks
can also help a customer with checkout and payment.</p>



<h3>5. Functional Automated Phone Systems</h3>



<p>While the phone remains the preferred business interaction
channel for a large section of customers, the younger generation sees it as the
last resort. You can find a middle ground and offer them the option to speak to
a representative or resolve the issue following an automated menu system and accomplish
the task quickly without needing an agent. </p>



<p>These five types of self-service can help your customers to
quickly find the answer to their queries without needing an agent and boost
their customer experience as well.</p>
