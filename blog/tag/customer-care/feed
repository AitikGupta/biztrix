								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know about the current contact center trend moving around the world?

<p>Potential buying traffic is diverted to contact centers for various reasons, especially for the sales opportunities. However, converting these opportunities to real revenue in the challenge.</p>
<p>Fusion has revamped the customer care service with 5 effective ways. Let us see what they are:</p>
<h3>Bringing the Change in Hiring Engine</h3>
<p>The employee recruitment process focuses on identifying, selecting and recruiting candidates who has the professional traits to handle the call within the contact centers. Some of the traits include:</p>

The contact center agent’s helps to increase up sell and cross sell and offers a new product and service. Just to provide an early version it is essential to put forward a good sales-closing question. Introduction to the domain is also an eminent way to build a confident pool so that agents could sell better. However, training is not limited to contact center agents; the team managers are also associated.</p>

Planning and scheduling not only help to increase the chance of up sell and cross sell, but also bolsters the impetus of the agent to take care of the customers.</p>
<h3>Incentives</h3>

At Fusion, we recommend the outcome-based incentive structure for sales on high margin products and revenue generated in each transaction.</p>
<h3>Valuable Feedback</h3>
