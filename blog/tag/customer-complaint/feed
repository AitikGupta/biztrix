<p>A lack of customer complaint is not always the best news for
a business.&nbsp; In fact, customer complaint
is good for business.&nbsp; It provides
businesses with an insight about what they need to improve or change to keep
the customers happy.</p>



<p>So, even if you get vitriol from the customer, please note
that it may contain valuable customer feedback underneath it. It is important
to remember that every negative experience can be salvaged and transformed into
an opportunity. All you need to do is to carefully asses and address every
customer complaint.</p>



<p>As per data nine out of ten times, a customer will continue
doing business with you even after a slip-up—but only if you wholly fix the
situation the first time. And therein lies the merits of dealing with the
angriest of your customers. Fusion has some nuggets of wisdom to share in this
regard that we have acquired over more than 15 years:</p>



<h3>1. Look past the rage</h3>



<p>just because your customer is spewing vitriol does not mean there
is no merit in his argument. Every argument, including the angry ones, has some
insight. It is the job of the business to listen to each of its customers and
act upon their feedback.</p>



<h3>2. Record useful complaint</h3>



<p>While helping customers is important, meeting their every
demand without a second thought is wrong.&nbsp;
It encourages some customers to demand free stuff.</p>



<p>For this reason, you need to record every customer complaint
in an organized way. Evaluate each complaint and categorize them. The key is to
make it easy, and browse-able. Give your team clear instructions to make note
of every useful complaint, and you can rest easy because you will hear about
them.</p>



<h3>3. Identify the type of customer you are communicating with</h3>



<p>You should use different tactics to deal with different
customers. And for that you need to understand the customer types. Here are the
most prominent types you will be communicating with:</p>



<ul><li><strong><em>Meek customers</em></strong> – they need probing
from your end</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Aggressive customers </em></strong>– they need to
be dealt with firm politeness</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>High roller customer</em></strong> – they pay well
and demand premium support for it. They need to be on a VIP list.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Chronic complainer</em></strong> – these customers
should be dealt with patience.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Never-happy customer</em></strong> – they need to
be dealt with as firmly as possible</li></ul>



<h3>4. Don&#8217;t be passive aggressive</h3>



<p>Say you are sorry and mean it.&nbsp; Never misuse the tone and sound dismissive
while apologizing to the customers. They will appreciate your apology.</p>



<h3>5. Transfer calls only after some explanation</h3>



<p>no one likes their calls to get transferred. Therefore, if you have to do it, kindly provide the customer with an explanation. this will help you earn their trust.</p>



<p>Follow these simple rules while talking to the angriest customer. </p>
