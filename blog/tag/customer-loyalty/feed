<p>Customer experience is the need of the hour. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-quick-tips-can-improve-your-customer-experience-instantly.html">Great customer experience can make your customers happy</a> and happy customers result in more business.  That is why more and more businesses these days are trying to provide their customers with state-of-the-art customer service. </p>



<p>Today when the customers expect nothing but the best
treatment from the company, the standard customer service cannot offer the same
level of satisfaction. For that, you need to shift from reactive to proactive
customer service.&nbsp; </p>



<h2>What is Reactive and Proactive Customer Service?</h2>



<p>Reactive customer service is when a customer has a question
while browsing your website, contacts you via different communication channels
and waits for a response. This is the standard customer service that most companies
provide. </p>



<p>Proactive customer service means anticipating customer
issues and addressing them proactively through a number of communication
channels (including forums, FAQs, knowledge base, and instructional videos).
Reaching out to your customers to inform them about a problem before they have
experienced it is an example of proactive customer service. Proactive customer
service has the power to get your customers live for your brand.</p>



<h2>Why is Proactive Support Important?</h2>



<p>Proactive customer support offers a number of benefits for
your business. These are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increase
customer loyalty</strong> – According to a report by <a href="https://medium.com/@Workato/what-role-will-ai-play-in-the-future-of-customer-service-7332a7e503b7">Enkata</a>
taking initiative in your support can boost customer retention rates by 3-5%.</li><li><strong>Decrease
support calls</strong> – Being proactive can help your business identify issues and
resolve them before they turn into problems, and thus can reduce the number of
tickets you receive.</li><li><strong>Take
charge of communication</strong> – By being proactive you can get involved in what
your customers are saying about your brand in private and on social media.&nbsp; You will also get a chance to engage with
them in a way that puts your business in a favorable light.</li><li><strong>Acquire
new customers</strong> &#8211; By being proactive you will get the opportunities to reach
out to prospective customers, and encourage them to switch to your brand.</li><li><strong>Retain
existing customers</strong> &#8211; When you proactively reach out to your customers, even
when they haven’t mentioned you directly, it deepens the relationship. With
social media customer service on the rage, you will need to go that extra mile
to exceed their expectations of good customer service. </li><li><strong>Create brand
advocates</strong> &#8211; Proactive customer service offers the chance to turn your
customers into brand advocates. &nbsp;Studies
show that a happy customer will tell at least 3 people about their experience.</li><li><strong>Protection
against escalation</strong> &#8211; You can avoid a social crisis by early identification
negativity surrounding your brand. </li></ul>



<p>This shows that proactive is the way to go for customer service.  While reactive customer service will cover your base, proactive customer service will take customer satisfaction and loyalty to a whole new level. According to a study by inContact, consumers were generally positive with proactive service. In fact, 87% of adults surveyed are happy to be contacted proactively by different companies regarding customer service issues. </p>



<h2>So How to Introduce Proactive Customer Service in Your Business? </h2>



<p>Here are a few easy tips:</p>



<h4>1. Ask for Feedback</h4>



<p>Customer service is about giving customers what they want. So, the first thing you have to do is to find out what they want. And the best way to do so is by asking them. If you check on your customers regularly, you may identify your weakness and correct them before your customers start to resent it. </p>



<h4>2. Announce Your Mistakes Before Customers Find Out</h4>



<p>Have you identified a problem in your product, service or
operations? It is better than your customers hear about it directly from you
instead of finding out themselves. Admitting your mistake, apologizing, fixing
the issue quickly, and/or offering a discount to compensate for their
inconvenience can help you earn your customer’s trust, avoid bad PR, and ensure
that the customers do not go anywhere.&nbsp; </p>



<h4>3. Reward Customer Loyalty </h4>



<p>Offering rewards for regular business is a good
loyalty-building tool. Loyalty programs demonstrate your company’s desire to
reward a customer as a token of thanks. You can proactively reach out to
customers with offers in between purchases. This can be a chance for positive
interaction with customers that strengthens their relationship with your
company. For example – you can send a discount voucher to your customers a
month before their subscription with you ends, compelling them to renew the
subscription. </p>



<h4>3. Pay Attention to What Your Customers Are Saying Online</h4>



<p>Pay close attention to what your customers are saying about
your brand online. If you reach out to customers who mentioned your brand in
their post, whether in a good context or bad, you will be able to address their
needs preemptively and increase their customer satisfaction.</p>



<h4>4. Create A Knowledge Base for Common Questions</h4>



<p>If you look carefully, you will find a set of common
questions that your customers frequently ask your customer support team or
search online. If you create a knowledge base where the answers to these
questions are provided, it will help your customers easily get their answers
without calling your customer service department. It will save time and bring
down the number of support calls. </p>



<h4>5. Introduce Live Chat</h4>



<p>Having a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="live chat (opens in a new tab)">live chat</a> on your website helps your customers resolve their queries while browsing your site. According to some, the ability to get answers from a live chat representative during an online purchase is among the most important features a business can offer. Proactively asking your customers if they need help through live chat can result in more business.</p>



<p>These are a few tips that can help your business adopt proactive customer service practices.  </p>
