								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/6-customer-service-horror-stories-that-will-leave-you-appalled-this-halloween.html" target="_blank">Halloween</a>, the festive season has already arrived.  Every corner of the world is celebrating festivals and being a global company; Fusion is fortunate to take part in some major ones.</p>
<p>We’ve had our trick-or-treat, and now it’s time for us to take part in <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali" target="_blank">Diwali</a>, the festival of lights</strong>, celebrated by the Indian Hindu community around the world.</p>
<p>Diwali, one of the most popular Indian festivals signifies the victory of good over evil and is celebrated by lighting lamps (<em>diyas</em>) and decorating houses with fairy lights, candles and much more.</p>
<p>People worship the deity and celebrate the day with joy and gusto. Oh… and there’s also some incredible fireworks. It’s like 4th of July and Christmas fun concentrated in a single day.</p>
<p>In the spirit of Diwali, we bring you a blog that shows you how little efforts can that brightens a customers’ day.  They are as follows-</p>
<ol>
<li>When in doubt, being good always helps.</li>
<li>Say “<em>Thank you</em>” to your customer honestly and often.</li>
<li>Suggest a solution to the problem apart from asking for additional information.</li>
<li>Offer to provide further assistance via email or call back.</li>
<li>Following up an issue after it has been resolved is a good practice. It lets the customer know that you still have them in mind.</li>
<li>Create customary responses for the 20% of cases that your business encounters 80% of the time.</li>
<li>Include more “<em>closed question</em>” options in your application to reduce decision fatigue.</li>
<li>Define how your product does or service makes a difference in a customer’s life and what problems does it solve?</li>
<li>Define a customer’s journey in a lifecycle and record its progress.</li>
<li>Make sure that a customer’s case is handled by one person throughout the lifetime of that case.</li>
<li>Draw the attention of people towards your organization doing something right.</li>
<li>Create a transparent escalation process and evaluate how many cases are in a state of escalation.</li>
<li>Maintain relationships with top-notch customers and talk to them at least once a month. Making a schedule will help both the parties.</li>
<li>Define simple, scalable goals to improve service for everyone, even if it’s outside of their “job description”.</li>
<li>Try doing things from the customer’s point of view. It will be a learning experience for both of you.</li>
<li>Respond pronto. If you do not know the answer say so, ask for time and get back to them when you have the answer. If you are not able to solve the problem, say so. Keeping the customer hanging will only frustrate them further.</li>
<li>On special occasions, send physical thank you notes to your customers.</li>
<li>Provide off-hours support via email or chat.</li>
<li>Have multiple contact channels and make sure customer can reach you via each of it. Also, funnel the inbound contacts into one place.</li>
<li>Ask your customers, employees, as well as partners: “<em>how can we do better</em>”?</li>
</ol>
<p>Apparently, these are very small changes you can bring in your customer service and yet, the impact they have on the psyche of a customer is extraordinary. They not only transform their customer experience but also turn them into loyal customers and brand advocates. Remember, a good customer experience can brighten a customer’s day and make it a happy one.</p>
<p>This Diwali, Fusion pledges to spread more happiness to all the customers of their esteemed clients.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>We wish you a very Happy Diwali.</strong></span></h2>
