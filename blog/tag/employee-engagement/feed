								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gamification is a fun and growing way that can improve collection call center performance and agent engagement. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">Gamification</a> has been very effective in improving employee performance and business results at collections-focused contact centers. Benefits of gamification programs include increased revenues from higher recovery rates, improved compliance, making training more fun and effective, and improved employee retention.</p>



<p>Employee engagement is a persistent problem of
collection-based call centers. Due to unengaged employees, collection call
centers often face an issue like: </p>



<ul><li>Flat or declining recovery rates</li><li>High abandon rates</li><li>Increased customer service complaints</li><li>Increased compliance violations</li><li>High employee attrition rates</li></ul>



<p>However, by adding gamification to the mix, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/collection-services.html">collection call centers</a> can improve script adherence, raising recovery rates, improving compliance with disclosure requirements, and reducing the onboard time for new agents by making training more effective. This change in agent behavior also helps collection centers to improve customer satisfaction ratings.</p>



<p>Having a long experience in the collection industry, Fusion
has a step-by-step approach in designing a gamification strategy to engage its
collection agents.&nbsp; </p>



<ol><li>Define goals</li><li>Apply interaction analytics to identify baseline
performance and improvement opportunities</li><li>Define key performance indicators (KPIs) for the
program</li><li>Identify the appropriate motivators for agents</li></ol>



<p>With our experience in this field, we understand that
successful gamification is not game oriented but goal oriented. Rooted in clear
business goals quantifiable by appropriate metrics, successful gamification
needs to have the right motivators so that agents can easily get hooked. Some
important things to remember while designing a gamification program:</p>



<h3>1. Define Goals</h3>



<p>A gamification program without a defined business goal is
doomed to fail from the beginning. If you don’t know what you want to achieve
through the program, running the program has no point at all. Whether you want
to improve customer satisfaction by 5%, reduce 10% employee attrition, or
improve your recovery rates, you need to be clear about that even before
designing a gamification program.</p>



<h3>2. Define KPI</h3>



<p>Having the right metrics is the key. You cannot judge
customer satisfaction by looking at script adherence rate. To make a
gamification program successful, you need appropriate metrics that help you
measure your success in terms of your business goals. You can use analytics to
keep a track of how things are going and whether there is any scope for
improvement.</p>



<h3>3. Choose Motivators</h3>



<p>Choosing motivators can be a difficult task as not everyone
is motivated by the same thing. While baby boomers get motivated to earn points
and rewards, millennials get motivated by public recognition. Therefore, it can
be easily said that there is no one size fits all reward.&nbsp; While money can be a powerful reward, it is
not the only effective incentive. Incentives like paid time off, meals,
merchandise, company gear, recognition on the company’s social media page are a
few other incentives that work well.</p>



<h3>4. Set Time Limits</h3>



<p>A contest that goes on indefinitely will lose its effectiveness. Setting a certain start and end time helps businesses raise participation and effort while the contest is in effect. If a long-term program is needed to meet the business goal (<em>for example improving a 5 percent improvement in customer satisfaction ratings every year</em>), consider conducting a series of consecutive contests rather than one long one. </p>



<p>It is important to recognize the end of the program where
top performers will be recognized and participants will be updated about the result
and how the program helped meeting the business goal. You can also conclude the
program with a small party to get the feedback that can help you make future
engagements more effective. </p>



<h3>5. Inspire Continued Involvement</h3>



<p>Contests should have the mechanisms to motivate participants
to stay involved, even after meeting the performance required or when they have
almost zero chance of winning. You can encourage agents to continue working
towards goals as groups. That way, they will be able to achieve more than they
can achieve individually.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Fusion has seen that providing rewards for meeting
performance thresholds is a great way to promote continued involvement and keep
participants motivated. Reward thresholds can also be used in combination with
more competitive contests to get more effective results.</p>



<h3>6. Communicate</h3>



<p>To maximize the effectiveness of a gamification program you need consistent communication before, during, and after the contest. This will help organizations maximize agent participation in a program, improve buy-in by helping agents understand why a certain goal or metric is vital, explain rules clearly so that there is no confusion or hard feelings about unclear rules, and make motivation more effective by bringing good performers into the limelight. Fusion has always found communication to be the key to successful gamification programs in a collection call center. </p>



<p>These are some of the ways a collection call center can improve its employee engagement and customer experience through the call center. The key is to find a defined goal, time limit, performance indicators, and the right motivator, and measuring it all through application analytics. If you rightly engage your employees through gamification, your employees will be inspired to perform at optimum level even after the program ended, resulting in better customer experience as well. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disengaged employees have always been a major issue in the BPO industry. If employees are not fully engaged in their tasks, they tend to under perform. This may cost the company dearly. That is not all, the disengaged agents are often the first ones to jump ship causing the high level of attrition often seen at call centers.</p>
<p>With such major effects on call center performance, employee engagement should not be taken lightly. Steps ought to be taken to prevent disengagement at all costs.</p>
<p>Fusion has faced similar problems in the past and has found that a number of things trigger disengagement. Want to know about them? let’s dig in.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of recognition</strong> – When an agent’s good deeds go unnoticed or the Supervisors do not re agonize their high-quality performance; the Agent tends to feel dejected and disheartened.  This may lead to a dip in his/her morale.</li>
<li><strong>Repetitive work</strong> – Call center work is more or less repetitive and it’s easy to lose interest in the work.  As a result, employees become less engaged.</li>
<li><strong>Unpleasant co-worker or Supervisor</strong> – Supervisors are often the number one cause of employee attrition. Unpleasant co-workers too can affect employee engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of advancement</strong> – According to many, the chance of advancement and learning new skills are slim in a call center environment. Add to it the repetitive functions and you will find that the employees may find it hard to stay engaged for a long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, what can a call center do to improve the situation? Well, a business can handle numerous problems, while the others they cannot. Take the repetitive work for example, a problem no call center can solve. As for the other issues, appropriate measures can be taken.</p>
<p>Here are a few practical solutions to assuage employee disengagement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognize every effort</strong>: &#8211; when an employee makes sincere effort to excel on the job, the effort has to be recognized individually and in team meetings.  By doing so, a company will ensure that no good performance or innovation goes unnoticed and at the same time, other employees tend to be motivated.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain a healthy work environment</strong>:- A healthy work environment can solve a host of problems.  If an employee is treated well by his/her Supervisor and colleagues, his/her morale will boost and it will eventually make him/her more engaged.</li>
<li><strong>Hold the Managers accountable</strong>:- when the Managers are held accountable for disengagement and attrition, they are more likely to take initiatives regarding employee engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Let the HR department take initiative</strong>:- to keep the work environment interesting even when the work itself is repetitive, the HR department needs to make a sincere effort. The effort can be as simple as occasional team luncheon or Intra-organization quiz competition. Anything that keeps things interesting on the work front, will engage the employees and be welcome ones.</li>
<li><strong>Help the agents learn new skills</strong> – allow the agents to learn new skills that will not only make their task easier but also help them in their future endeavours. It can be as simple as  learning advanced excel lessons to learning a new language. This will not only assist the employees in improving their performance but also will keep them engaged. An enhanced skill set will also help an employee grow within an organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are a few ways fusion tackles its employee disengagement problem.  So far, these small changes have worked wonders in our favor.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Easter approaches, it’s now official that spring has sprung. The new financial year has begun. And it’s time for a fresh start.  So, the businesses need to come out of their hibernate mode and shake things up a bit.</p>
<p>Now that won’t be much of a difficulty for the businesses.  There are always some major areas that can welcome a few changes. For example, in BPOs, employee attrition is a pressing issue.  Every year thousands of BPO employees leave an organization to join another, and at the same time, switch careers.</p>
<p>So what is this reason behind such a high rate of attrition? Lack of engagement is one of the major reasons behind this. Believe it or not, a section of your employees are completely disengaged.  They neither share the company perspective nor bring something to the table to enhance the outlook.  They just clock in and clock out while not contributing substantially.</p>
<p>As a result, the entire operation of a BPO faces problems.  When these non-engaged employees commune with the customers, they are not able to build a strong bond. As a result, the optimum level customer satisfaction is not met.</p>
<p>Did you know that about half members of your workforce is probably not engaged?  According to a semi-annual Employment Engagement Index by <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gallup Management Journal</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 13% of employees round the world are actively engaged in their jobs. They are passionate about their organization and help move the organization forward.</li>
<li>63% employees are not engaged and put no passion into their work. They remain active but accomplish nothing to benefit the company.</li>
<li>24% employees are actively disengaged and busy venting and showing their unhappiness, which in turn, undermines what their engaged co-workers are trying to accomplish.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a competitive world, customer satisfaction often has the final words in the purchase decision.  Therefore, it is very important. And to achieve the level of satisfaction, it is essential that each of the contact center employees is highly motivated and give their 100% to the job.</p>
<h2><strong>Gamify Your Employee Engagement Strategy</strong></h2>
<p>Now, the most important question remains – how to re-engage these employees? There are several ways.  But so far, applying gamification techniques to re-engage staff has worked wonders for most companies.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, what does an employee want most out of his job? Money? No. They want recognition, appreciation and rewards.  These are some great motivators that can surely engage employees.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="http://www.cognizant.com/InsightsWhitepapers/Gamifying-Business-to-Drive-Employee-Engagement-and-Performance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cognizant</a> rightly points out that gamification is as much needed in terms of employee engagement as it is needed  to increase customer engagement. Today, the SMAC stack or social, mobile, analytics and cloud technology has opened new opportunities for engaging customers through various channels.  A company can also use the similar channels to engage employees. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The Marriott Group <a href="http://news.marriott.com/2011/06/my-marriott-hotel-opens-its-doors-on-facebook.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uses</a> My Marriott Hotel Facebook game for recruitment. Similar to FarmVille, the game requires job aspirants to manage the hotel’s kitchen operations, earning or losing points based on customer satisfaction. This way, the company can attract and recruit talented employees.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6108" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marriott-hotel-facebook-game.jpg" alt="Marriott Uses Social Media Gaming" width="595" height="450" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marriott-hotel-facebook-game.jpg 595w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marriott-hotel-facebook-game-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Target stores have implemented a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5421678/target-makes-cashiering-more-tolerable-by-turning-it-into-a-game" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">game</a> for their cashiers to play when checking people out. It shows the cashier that whether the item that was just scanned in the optimum time. Then they can see their score on screen and know whether they are using their time optimally.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6107" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/game-for-cashiers.jpg" alt="Target stores game for their cashiers" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/game-for-cashiers.jpg 500w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/game-for-cashiers-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Some organizations create interesting festivity games like the Easter egg hunt to keep the employees engaged and share the results of each level of the game on social media tagging the winners. This gives the employees a sense of belonging, which in turn help them reconnect with the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Fusion, we keep our agents engaged with regular feedback, interesting games and other fun activities and we feature our winners on our social media pages.</p>
<p><strong>For Easter, you can have some special gamification plans. Such as &#8211;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Revamping the game ‘<em>Steal the Egg</em>’ to suit the office environment. Every agent will have their own basket of eggs and when one makes an upsell, they will be free to steal one egg from another. At the end of the day, the one with the highest number of eggs will get a special prize.</li>
<li>You may also put a large egg basket with the amount of money written in the eggs. For each successful sales, agents will be allowed to take one egg and will be rewarded the money immediately.</li>
<li>You can also play the game while replacing the money with experience &#8211; ‘<em>Can go home 2 hour early</em>’, ‘<em>Gets a Domino’s gift voucher</em>’, ‘<em>Wins a free trip for two to an amusement park</em>’, ‘Gets to play the role of Team Leader for one day’ and so on. It is often said that the employees love experiences more than money. It’s time to test that faith.</li>
</ul>
<p>A survey by the <a href="http://www.aberdeen.com/_aberdeen/app/research-survey/library.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aberdeen Group</a> found that organizations who set up gamification improve engagement by 48% and turnover by 36%.  Therefore, this Easter, businesses should start fresh and gamify their processes to engage their employees, which in turn will bring them better turnover and heightened customer satisfaction.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s begin with a joke, shall we?  &#8211; “<em>A CEO was asked how many people work in his company: ‘About half of them,’ he responded</em>.” After the session, several participants put a more serious face on the problem when, while chatting, they bemoaned the fact that, in their organization, a significant number of people had mentally “<em>checked out</em>.”</p>
<p>It is possible that many of you can actually understand the real picture behind this joke. <a href="http://www.dalecarnegie.com/employee-engagement/how-to-engage-employees-by-fostering-positive-emotions-infographic/" target="_blank">Employee engagement</a> has become one of the major issues for organizations nowadays. While an engaged employee is fully involved in, committed to and enthusiastic about, his or her work, a mentally checked out employee is not motivated or enthusiastic about his or her work or workplace.</p>
<p>And therein is the problem. How does the company management expect to do great thing when most of its employees are fully involved and enthusiastic about their work or about the bigger picture?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx" target="_blank">The Gallup Management Journal</a> publishes a semi-annual Employment Engagement Index. In the most recent U.S. results it is showing that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 13% of employees worldwide are actively engaged in their jobs. They are passionate about their company. These actively engaged people help move the organization forward.</li>
<li>63% employees are not engaged. These employees put no passion into their work. They are active but are not accomplishing anything to benefit the company.</li>
<li>24% employees are actively disengaged and busy acting out their unhappiness, which in turn, undermines what their engaged co-workers are trying to accomplish.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Towers Perrin 2005 Global Workforce Survey that involved about 85,000 people working full-time for large and midsize firms yielded similar disturbing results.</p>
<p>Engaged employees put their heart, head and hands in work and accomplish more than their non engaged colleagues. And that means more success to the company and its people.</p>
<p>So, how to keep the employees engaged? We bring you the Ten C’s of employee engagement.</p>
<h3>THE TEN C’S OF EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Communicate</strong> – Not communicating with your employees in a positive way means your organization is doomed to fail. A two-way communication flow is essential for both employee engagement and the success of your organization.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Connect:</strong> Leaders must show that they value employees with employee-focused initiatives such as profit sharing and implementing work–life balance initiatives.  But most importantly, they should cultivate a great relationship with their employees and walk the talk when they say, “<em>Our employees are our most valuable asset</em>.”</p>
<p>3.  <strong>Career:</strong> Leaders should provide challenging and meaningful work to their employees along with opportunities for career advancement. Most people want to do new things in their job. Therefore, to bring out the best in your employees you should challenge them and at the same time give them the knowledge and tool for achieving their goal.</p>
<p>This instills a new confidence in them.  On the other hand not giving one the aid they need to meet the challenges is plainly unethical and demotivating,  which leads to  stress, frustration, and, lack of engagement.</p>
<p>4.  <strong>Clarity:</strong> Leaders must communicate a clear vision. Success in life as well as in organizations is determined by how clear one sees their goals. So, employees need to understand what the organization’s goals are, their importance, and how the goals can be attained. Having a clear vision about the goal, and how one can contribute to it, always keeps the employees engaged.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Convey:</strong> Good leaders set up processes and procedures to help people master important tasks and thus, facilitate goal achievement.  Giving regular positive and constructive feedbacks to employees often bring out the best in them and these small achievements collectively help the company win big.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Congratulate:</strong> In most cases, employees feel that they receive immediate feedback when their performance is poor, or below expectations. But giving recognition, coaching and congratulating employees on their improvement is a good way to use feedbacks as a constructive tool.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Contribute:</strong> Employees want to know that their input matters. They also want to know that they are giving meaningful contribution to the organization’s success and future. When they understand this, their work-related behavior improves enormously.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Control:</strong> Giving employees the opportunity to voice their ideas and needs, take part in decision-making and setting milestones or targets and showing that their opinions and contributions are valued by the leaders can keep them passionate about the job they are doing.  Giving some control to drive an initiative to the employees can make them feel empowered and ultimately highly in sync with the organization.</p>
<p>9. <strong>Collaborate:</strong> It is often seen that, when team members have the trust and cooperation of each other, they outperform individuals and teams which lack good relationships. Great leaders create an environment that fosters trust and collaboration. Being cared about by colleagues often leads one to strong employee engagement.</p>
<p>So, the leaders must rally individuals to collaborate on a common goal, however small or big it is, and at the same time, must exclude individuals pursuing their self-interest. At Fusion, we always foster a healthy relationship among our employees and drive them towards a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>10<strong>. Credibility:</strong> You should try hard to maintain a company’s reputation and maintain high ethical standards. Employees of an organization want to be proud of their jobs, performance, and their organization.</p>
<p>10. <strong>Confidence:</strong> You create confidence in a company by setting an example of high ethical and performance standards. This make the employees look up to you.</p>
<p>As a leader, you should actively try to identify the level of engagement in your organization, find the reasons behind the lack of engagement, and strive to eliminate those reasons. You should also implement behavioral strategies to facilitate full engagement.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we believe that employee engagement is not a one-time gig. It’s an ongoing process.</p>
