								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>First contact resolution (FCR) is a critical key performance indicator (<a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-technologies-boost-up-the-kpi.html">KPI</a>) in measuring both the quality of the customer experience as well as the efficiency of a contact center. According to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/increase-efficiency-drive-down-cost-and-improve-customer-satisfaction-all-at-the-same-time/">research</a>, a 1% improvement in FCR can mean a 1% improvement in customer satisfaction, too. However, it can be a challenge both in terms of measurement and continuous improvement.</p>



<p>When a customer has to repeatedly contact a business to resolve an issue, they get frustrated and very disappointed with the service.  On the contrary, when an agent resolves the issue in the very first contact, it creates a better customer experience and marks the operational efficiency of a call center.</p>



<p>Measurement of first contact resolution typically comes down to the customers’ feedback on whether the inquiry was resolved to their satisfaction. You may need to use a number of different tracking methods in order to capture this information.</p>



<p>With a little effort from your end, FCR can be boosted.  Want to know about them? Here we have 8 ways to improve your call center FCR:</p>



<h2>1. Train call center agents to handle most queries</h2>



<p>A skills matrix helps you see the abilities of your agents at a glance. Training programs need to be tailored accordingly with the goal of nurturing and developing your team. A knowledge base for frequently asked questions can help less skilled agents can easily find out ways to resolve common issues.</p>



<h2>2. Use call routing technology to find the right agent on the first call</h2>



<p>Skill-based routing should be there to ensure customers are matched up with the best agent for the call.  Calls should be based on language proficiency or product knowledge and aligned your agents’ skills in real-time. Intelligent call routing or data-directed routing lets you interrogate data within your CRM and factor it into the routing process. </p>



<p>This way, a customer with an ongoing, active complaint could be routed directly to a supervisor. Immediate callbacks to customers who abandon a queue or get disconnected can also help you turn bad customer experience into a service recovery opportunity.</p>



<h2>3. Eliminate conflicting KPIs that could work against FCR</h2>



<p>If your staff is being measured for Average Handle Time (AHT), it can have a negative impact on successful First Call Resolution. It happens quite often and therefore needs addressing. Eliminating these conflicting KPIs can help agents focus on FCR.</p>



<h2>4. Use Incentive to boost FCR</h2>



<p>Make your agents aware of the importance of first contact resolution and good customer service. If you want your agents to focus on FCR, it needs to be deeply ingrained within the company culture. You can use incentives to motivate agents to perform against your FCR goals.</p>



<h2>5. Measure First Call Resolution consistently</h2>



<p>A sophisticated call recording system is essential to quality monitoring and call ratings. However, post-call customer surveys too can be used for measuring first call resolution as only the customer can provide an honest perspective on whether they feel their issue has been resolved. Asking the customers about their experience on social media too can help you get an honest answer. You need to adopt a multi-touchpoint approach to measuring first contact resolution to get the correct picture of customer satisfaction.</p>



<h2>6. Encourage feedback from staff</h2>



<p>Encourage staff feedback and make it a part of your operation.  It will help you understand whether an issue is recurring or not. Acting upon the inputs from the agents will help you nip a recurring problem at the bud.</p>



<h2>7. Check your IVR system</h2>



<p>You should review your IVR system from time to time to ensure that it is up-t-date and getting the right customer to the right place without delay.</p>



<h2>8. Tweak the scripting process to boost FCR</h2>



<p>Dynamic agent scripting that integrates with your <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/can-you-build-better-call-center-metrics-with-crm.html">CRM system can help</a> agents to adequately handle customer issues during the first call resolution.</p>



<p>These are the eight ways you can work on to improve your call center FCR, efficiency, and customer experience.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want to provide effective social customer service, you need to be prompt. However, with a growing number of social platforms as well as customers using social media as a support channel, many businesses are finding it difficult to keep up.</p>
<p>Even businesses with dedicated social customer service teams are looking for ways to efficiently go through all the comments and questions directed at them <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/customers-switch-channels-for-issue-resolution.html">via various social media channels</a>.</p>
<p>As teams try hard to streamline and optimize their processes, choosing the right metrics and tracking them regularly becomes increasingly important.  Here are five key social customer service performance indicators, every business should be tracking daily:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>Social Activity per Hour</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you track social activity broken down by the hour, it will help you better understand your workload. Keeping track of this information on a daily basis will allow you to recognize traffic patterns and prepare for spikes in interactions.</p>
<p>Knowing the social activity per hour also allows a business to staff their team strategically, so that optimum coverage during high traffic, times can be forecasted. There are times when social traffic takes place beyond usual business hours.</p>
<p>Tracking this metric will help businesses prepare for those times, by creating additional shifts or hiring a support team in another time zone.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2>Response Rates</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is beneficial to know how quickly your team is able to respond to customer queries and/or feedback that require a response. It will help you track average response times by the day of the week and time of the day.</p>
<p>This will help you find out if and when the response times are falling short of your goals; if it happens during a particular time of the day, and you need to adjust your staffing levels.</p>
<p>Apart from this, tracking average time to first action will also be beneficial for your business. In cases where customer inquiries are more complicated than others, it is natural for your social customer service team to need more time to respond to certain requests.</p>
<p>However, they should be able to provide an initial response within the expected time frame.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2>Engagement with Unique Users</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want a better understanding of the <a href="http://www.sociableblog.com/">impact of social media</a> and the reach of your brand, you need to track the number of times your company is mentioned each day and break that number down into unique mentions.</p>
<p>Pay more attention to these unique mentions and track the engagement your team has with this particular subset. This highlights the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/social-customer-services-personalize-customer-support.html">importance of social customer service</a> in maintaining as well as building relationships with your customers.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2>Customer Sentiment</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding customer sentiment should not only be seen as a key performance indicator, it can also provide a business with actionable insight. As you <a href="http://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/5-tools-tracking-brand-mentions-youll-actually-want-use">track the brand mentions</a> every single time, you get to measure the sentiment in specific areas that matter to your business.</p>
<p>For example: a hotel should measure sentiments in areas like ease of check-in, booking, food, room amenities etc. At the same time, a manufacturer of consumer packaged goods should measure sentiments for product quality, price, purchase process, availability, and offers.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2>Total Mentions That Require Actions</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A business should track all brand mentions that require actions. Setting up separate feeds populated with customer mentions flagged as requiring a response can make this easier for the team. With a queue of mentions that require action, your team will be able to deliver effective responses without missing a single customer.</p>
<p>As a need connoisseur of social media customer service, you should start by tracking these five key performance indicators and add them to the list of tracked data as per the unique requirements of your business.</p>
<p>Tracking these on a regular basis will equip your social customer service team with the insight and tools they need to provide high-quality customer experience to your customers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the ever-growing world of competition, businesses are becoming more and more dependent on BPOs for a large section of their core and non-core operations. BPOs are responsible for boosting revenue, maximizing productivity and reducing overhead cost.</p>
<p>As a result, the BPO industry today faces challenges in fields of Information management and Reporting.  The <a href="http://www.datamark.net/blog/10-bpo-trends-in-2013" target="_blank">upsurge in Big Data</a> and Social Media has made things even more difficult. Thankfully all these problems can be solved with the use of Business intelligence solutions.</p>
<p>A Business Intelligence system can help BPOs in <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/vikramkole/1-key-value-proposition-for-bpo" target="_blank">many areas</a> such as collecting data from customer interactions, analyzing it to understanding of what a customer wants. It also converts the data into actionable recommendations which can improve the performance of each department.</p>
<p>So how exactly can business intelligence improve the performance and operation of a BPO? Let’s find out.</p>
<h3>Operations: Efficiency vs. Cost –</h3>
<p>To attain success, BPOs need to strike a balance between cost and efficiency and that can be quite a challenging task.   A Business Intelligence system can offer the entire operation process with accurate information available at the right time to right people.</p>
<p>It provides with analytics to measure &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li>The factors that are affecting the efficiency and</li>
<li>The factors affecting the cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>With such information available at hand, BPO Managers can strike the right balance between both by making informed decisions.</p>
<h3>Performance Management –</h3>
<p>Managers can now take a break from time consuming data collection and reporting. The Performance management solution can empower them to capture as well as share customer data across the company.</p>
<p>The solution includes a series of procedures and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-technologies-boost-up-the-kpi.html" target="_blank">Key Performance Indicators</a> (KPIs) that needs to be captured, tracked as well as reported in order to make sure that departmental objectives are being met.</p>
<p>BPOs of every types and sizes can depend on Analytics and Reports to quantify the performance and take suitable actions to boost agent performance and lessen the effective operational cost.</p>
<h3>Knowledge Management –</h3>
<p>Intellectual capital and its successful use will be the key to gain competitive advantage in the rapidly changing global economy. Business Intelligence system can offer a basis for an end-to-end information management.</p>
<p>Using a Data Warehouse with Business Intelligence will allow an organization-wide system to cultivate new knowledge to gain competitive advantage, enabling access to a wide range of project as well as process information and sharing the best practices evolved in this course of working.</p>
<h3>Faster &amp; Accurate Results –</h3>
<p>Accurate reports and analytics can assist management with higher efficiency and in turn better customer satisfaction. Business Intelligence can integrate information from different systems in the BPO and fuse it into a single, easy to manage data repository to be used for providing personalized performance dashboards, automated reports as well as advanced analytical capabilities including drill-down, sorting and filtering.</p>
<p>We at Fusion believe that BPOs can offer major business value to their customers by deploying Business Intelligence.</p>
<p>From enhancing the top line to finding new avenues to reduce bottom line; from analytics on recruitment to retention; from trend analysis to customer retention; from profits to expenses; &#8211; Business Intelligence can provide enormous benefits.</p>
