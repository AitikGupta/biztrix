								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Owning a small business is tough. You have to juggle a lot of tasks, including answering calls. That’s one task that can claim a huge chunk of your precious time.</p>
<p>Don’t get us wrong.  We know that interacting with the buyer is one of the most crucial things to build your business. But spending too much time on answering the customer queries can shift your focus from the other important tasks, such as &#8211; marketing, and stocktaking.</p>
<p>The point is, it simply isn&#8217;t logical to spend much time on the phone when you have a business to manage.  Then again, if your customers and prospects reach your voicemail upon calling, they will be frustrated. That would lose you a lot of business. What to do?</p>
<p>Sure, you can hire a full-time employee to attend the calls. But that might just be a waste of money. What you can do instead, is hire an answering service. A virtual receptionist will ensure that your customers are received warmly every single time.  The service will maintain the highest level of efficiency, professionalism, and a personal touch.</p>
<p>A good live answering service helps a business solve a number of challenges, including:</p>
<h3>Providing customer support 24/7/365</h3>
<p>No matter how dedicated you are to your customers and business, you cannot always be there to answer the phone. Installing an answering machine or voicemail isn’t much help either; since most people are refusing to leave a message at the beep. On the other hand, an answering service available 24/7/365 at your aid means that there is a friendly agent to greet your callers, make them feel more comfortable to leave messages or ask questions, and get them what they need, pronto.</p>
<h3>Handling common issues without getting involved</h3>
<p>You can save your precious time and money by providing your answering service with specific instructions to handle common calls. Thus, when a caller inquires about your business hours or returns policy, the agent can provide them with that information right away.  There is no need for you to get involved.  They can even offer scripted guidance to aid a customer.  For example – while setting up an appointment with the doctor, an answering service hired by a doctor can remind people to bring previous prescriptions and other documents to the appointment.</p>
<h3>Re-routing calls to a designated emergency number</h3>
<p>You get your fair share of after-hour phone calls in the emergency number, and we know how much it stresses you out to handle them.  On the other hand, if you entrust the task to an answering service, they will make sure that each of the calls gets answered, each message gets noted, and you are not contacted unless there’s a real emergency. This way, your off time remains yours.</p>
<h3>Getting an organized list for call-backs</h3>
<p>Why waste time making a list of callers from your voicemail, when you can route calls through your answering service partner? You will receive a tidy log of callers, complete with their needs and phone numbers. You can quickly check the list off as you contact the callers. Being organized gives you the chance to become incredibly responsive to customer needs. You’ll return calls more quickly, and not forget a single message.</p>
<p>There are many challenges that hiring an answering service can solve quickly and affordably, irrespective of the size or type of your business. At Fusion, we are trained to keep your clients’ information confidential and secure while providing your business with a warm, friendly voice.</p>

The callers may contact an answering service call center with a general query on a product or service or an issue about a product/service; before a phone answering service agent advances to offer solutions, they must ask certain questions that enable them to help customers better and in a more effective manner. This may often end up in saving a lot of time for both the answering services and the callers.</p>
<p>For instance, if the caller has called to ask the agent how they can pay for ordering a product or service, the agents at the <strong><a title="live answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">live answering service</a></strong> call center must ask what mode of payment is convenient for the customers. This will help the conversation to be channelized; this implies that the caller will give a reply and the solution by the agents will be offered depending on this answer rather than saying about all the payment options and then having to repeat the solution after the caller tells of his/her choice of payment.</p>
<p>If agents are trained well to ask effective questions to the callers, the course of the conversation can also be directed towards convincing the callers in making purchases. The expertise of the agents lies in how well they are capable of asking the right questions on the spot and getting the customers to make purchases, repeat purchases or instill in their minds an interest on the clients’ products/services.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Live answering service call centers usually have a team of talented copywriters who design a call controlling script for the agents at the centers to follow. Agents are trained to follow the script so that they do not make mistakes and do not forget instructing or telling customers about something that they must know. However, when agents are naturally conversing with customers having the call controlling script just as a guide, they deliver better customer satisfaction levels.</p>
<p>Often agents at a telephone answering service may seem to be very dumb as these agents seem to read directly from the scripts without actually caring about and understanding what the customers have to say. Just merely reading from scripts will make <strong><a title="live answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">live answering service</a></strong> agents sound highly mechanical and like complete idiots. The customers might not be interested in paying attention to what these ‘robots’ have to say.</p>
<p>The agents that the customers are speaking o are expected to have high levels of intelligence, common sense and even traits of human emotion. Over scripting is not a good thing in telephone answering service call centers; often agents forget that the script is just a guide and they follow it word for word. The agents are trained to render a personal touch to the conversations so that the customers may be interested in talking to them without hanging up. It is better if the agents take the name of the customers and refer to them while talking.</p>
<p>If customers would want to hear robots, they would not have opted to talk to live agents, so agents must behave like real persons.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Call back feature is used in the live answering service call centers when callers call the numbers and then disconnects without waiting for a respondent to answer the call. The live answering service agents are required to dial the number back from where the missed call was made and get in touch with the person.</p>
<p>The call back feature is implemented through smart IVR that performs different tasks. The caller ID must be detected first and foremost by the <strong><a title="call answering services" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">call answering service</a></strong> and also looked up in a database to find out if the caller ID is registered for a call back service. In case, the caller ID that is detected is found to be a registered user for the call back service, an outbound call must be made to the number.</p>
<p>Once the caller ID takes the call, there must be a prompt for entering the phone number. The IVR system now makes another outbound call to the phone number that is entered at the prompt and then gets it bridged with the previous call.</p>
<p>The call back feature is a great tool for lowering the call costs and also effective when the phone answering service does not want the subscribers to make the support calls. This can be a substitute for the toll free numbers; when customers dial toll free numbers, they are not charged for the calls, but the call center has to pay per minute charges for the call. Thus, usage of IVR is a cost effective option for the call centers.</p>

For making IVR user-friendly, the phone answering service call centers have to focus on scripting menus, categorizing the complex menus into simpler sub-menus, as well as scripting phrases that are used for offering information.</p>
<p>In case of scripting, the menu options must be clearly scripted and accuracy of options is a must. The options must be appropriate so that callers can understand all options clearly. When dividing the complex or large options in IVR systems, live answering service firms either group options or categorizes options in two-level menus instead of having one. This assists the first time callers of businesses in using the IVR system and makes the entire process a smooth affair. This kind of division also makes the process much faster and saves time for the callers.</p>
<p>The phrases must also be scripted tactfully; the phrases are usually written by professional team of writers at the <strong><a title="live answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">live answering service</a></strong> call centers; these phrases are likely to be recorded or may be used with TTS. When proper scripts are absent at the call centers, the IVR might not be usable even by experts at handling IVR systems. The technology will be a total waste without proper script writing for it.</p>
