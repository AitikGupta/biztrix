								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no doubt about the fact that Manila BPO agents are economical options to the foreign business enterprises. However, more than often their efficiency is being questioned. Well there is this perception that reduced pricing implies low standard service. But such a perception holds no truth in case of the call center companies in Manila.</p>
<p>Let us trace the reasons that contribute to the high level of proficiency of the call center agents from Manila and are instrumental in creating a good name of the <strong><a title="Manila call center" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/philippines.html ">Manila call center</a></strong> companies in the global environment.</p>
<p>Most of these agents have high educational qualifications. A job opportunity in the call center industry is their way to earn a living in the absence of other employment options. So to impart in these qualified agents the basic skills of customer handling and marketing is no big deal.</p>
<p>The Filipinos have a good grasp over English; this is due to the long colonial relationship that they have shared with United States of America. For a long time English has been used as a medium of communication in almost all the educational and official institutions. The fluent and clear accent of the Filipinos, which is a result of continuous interaction have made them ideal agents for the call center companies in Manila.</p>
<p>Besides English, the Manila BPO companies have taken initiatives to train their agents so that they develop adequate knowledge of other international languages. This is definitely a prudent initiative keeping in mind the surrounding conditions. Multilingual call center support is the need of the hour indeed and Manila call center companies strives hard to provide quality multilingual support to their clients rather their customers.</p>
