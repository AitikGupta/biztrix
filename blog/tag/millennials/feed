<p>While we read a lot about how to provide <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/provide-quality-customer-service-to-the-millennials.html">quality
customer experience to the millennials</a> through business interactions,
little has been said about improving customer experience of the elderly. When
you have an elderly customer at the other end of the line, you should treat
them very differently from the way you deal with your millennial customers. </p>



<p>Dealing with an elderly customer comes with its own unique
challenges. You cannot deal with them the way you can deal with millennials and
middle-aged.&nbsp; The reasons behind this
are-</p>



<ul><li>Most of them are not that tech-savvy</li><li>Health deterioration has led to hearing loss and
memory loss among the elderly</li><li>They have a hard time remembering things and
therefore keeps repeating themselves.</li><li>They communicate slower</li><li>They do not like being patronized</li></ul>



<p>Elderly people often find it hard to understand the basics
of modern technology like fixing the simplest computer issue or resolving a
billing problem. Therefore, a customer service agent needs to give extra
attention while attending their calls.</p>



<p>Here are some suggestions for making the interaction go smoothly.</p>



<h3>1. Treat Them with Respect</h3>



<p>Seniors often feel like they are being patronized or belittled by young agents even when it is not so.&nbsp; Therefore, an agent needs to be extra cautious about while talking to them. Instead of talking down to elderly customers, the agent must recognize their wisdom and treat them with respect.</p>



<p>If it’s taking longer to reach a solution due to their slower communication, an agent must not let frustration show. Working with them in a non-condescending tone often achieves much better results.</p>



<h3>2. Write It Down</h3>



<p>Deafness and forgetfulness are often the most common
elements that comes with age and they make getting the message across a
challenge.&nbsp; Therefore, writing down the
information on a notepad or email can make the whole process a lot easier and
help them in a better way.</p>



<h3>3. Give Coupons</h3>



<p>Recognizing the economic standing of the senior customers is
the first step of forging a lasting relationship with your senior customers. Living
off their retirement funds, seniors can benefit from special discounts and
coupons. If you can provide them with special discounts whenever possible, it
will create a good relationship between you and your elderly customers who will
get a strong sense of customer experience. </p>



<h3>4. Patience is Virtue</h3>



<p>Seniors often take longer to make a decision, understand a
request, and respond. But that is no excuse for agents to show their annoyance
or frustration. On the contrary, patience is the key here. Agents need to
slowdown, listen, and gather all information. And once they do that, dealing
with senior customers gets a lot easier.</p>



<h3>5. Maintain a Cheerful and Helpful Attitude</h3>



<p>While the millennials prefer self-help tools, senior
customers are still mostly old-school – they prefer talking to a live agent,
either face-to-face or over the phone. Therefore, agents taking the calls
should maintain a cheerful and helpful attitude to give the senior customers a
good customer service experience.</p>



<h3>6. Lend an Ear</h3>



<p>Many of the elderly customers are lonely and do not even have someone to talk to.&nbsp; Therefore, they ted to talk more even while discussing business with a live human agent. Sharing stories or talking excessively makes them feel better and listening to them goes a long way to create a pleasant experience for them. So, do not cut them off while they are sharing their stories. It will help you resolve the problem and provide them with outstanding customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>While it is not guaranteed that all the elderly customers will have a great customer experience even when you follow the tips mentioned above, but these tips will definitely help you improve their experience and earn their loyalty.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The millennials are the largest demographic in today’s marketplace, and they are unlike any other generation before them. There are eighty million of these customers. Now, that’s an awful lot of people who can turn into brand advocates, or turn away from the brand. But here’s the thing.  If you are planning to follow the traditional route of customer service while serving the millennials, you are in for a shock. These consumers have a very different understanding of customer service expectations. Like we said, they are nothing like any generation before them.</p>
<p>Therefore, to offer millennials a great customer experience, a company must first understand them. If a company has not already started learning about the millennials, here are a few interesting facts that will actually help the businesses restructure their customer service offerings:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6239" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/millennial-chart.jpg" alt="Millennial Chart" width="600" height="210" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/millennial-chart.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/millennial-chart-300x105.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>Millennials are self-reliant</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is one of the most resilient features of the millennials. They do not like to depend on others. Therefore, whenever they need some product or service-related information, they are more likely to research the information themselves rather than call up a customer service agent.</p>
<p><strong>How can a company use this information to change customer service?</strong></p>
<p>You can help these customers by providing answers to frequently asked questions, solutions to commonly occurring problems with the product and upgrading information (when available) on your website. You can also set up self-help facilities such as IVR-enabled enquiries, billing information etc.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2>Millennials expect omnichannel experience</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Millennials want to have <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/deliver-optimum-customer-experience-within-an-omni-channel-strategy.html">omnichannel customer service experience</a> where they do not have to repeat the information provided by them via another channel. For example – they would want to call Customer Service to know about an issue they communicated through the mail, without repeating the issue to the agent on the call. In other words, they would want a seamless information flow that allows them to use any communication channel available to them.</p>
<p><strong> How can a company use this information to change customer service?</strong></p>
<p>A company can accumulate all their customer data from all channels into one place and make it accessible to all channels. This will allow the agent to see what issue the customer is facing or what exactly his expectation is. This will make customer service a lot easier and the calls too would be shorter as the customer does not have to repeat his problems. As a result, the hold time would be significantly lower for other calls and it will make customers happier.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong>Millennials want a quick solution. They want them now. And they take it personally if they do not get it.</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Millennials do not want to wait for a solution. They want prompt responses from the companies and expect first contact resolutions. They also get annoyed if they do not get it and rant about it on social media platforms. In other words, they have zero tolerance for a delay in service. They do not want to wait on hold to talk to a representative, wait for more than 2 hours for a response via email, and social media platforms. They want immediate response to chat or SMS communications as well.</p>
<p><strong>How can a company use this information to change customer service?</strong></p>
<p>As the millennials do not want to wait on hold, a company can offer them an option to get a call back at a time convenient to the customer. This will reduce the hold time and improve the customer experience manifold. Also, appointing agents to manage emails, chats and social media accounts round the clock seems like a good idea. It will ensure that no communication goes unnoticed. In case a customer rants about poor service or product over the internet, the company’s strategy should be to get him off the social media platform and resolve the issue offline.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2>Millennials value relationship and authenticity</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Though they love prompt responses, the millennials value a business-customer relationship. If a company cares for them, lives up to their service expectations and tries to help them going out of their ways, the millennials would share a stronger bond with the company and turn into brand loyalists. They will become life-long consumers of the brand, influence others to do the same and even protect the brand fiercely on social media.</p>
<p>But if there is one thing they cannot stand it’s fakeness. If the representatives of a company robotically serve the millennials following a script and withhold information from them to sell them stuff, they will be genuinely annoyed and may never do business with the company again.</p>
<p><strong>How can a company use this information to change customer service?</strong></p>
<p>Encourage a personalized and natural conversation between the agent and the customer. Allow the agents to go off the script and help them to stay on topic with the use of conversation pointers. Also, allow them the empowerment to make small decisions on behalf of the company such as allowing a discount to a longtime customer, recommending a new product that will enhance the brand experience for the customer (such as a new lens for a camera owned by the customer). A millennial customer will value that.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2>Millennials are not afraid to leave a company</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If a millennial customer is not satisfied with the product or service of a company, he/she may choose to leave the company anytime for another company selling similar products or services. They do not want to grumble about issues while continuing with the brand, they are the brand switchers.</p>
<p><strong>How can a company use this information to change customer service?</strong></p>
<p>A company must aim to offer a high-quality customer experience along with great products and services that keep the customers engaged to the brand. They have to frequently use engagement tools like discount, sale, coupons, free promotional products, merchandise and gifts to keep the millennials coming back. Friendly, effective and prompt customer service too is a good way to get into the good books of the millennials.</p>
