								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With customer communication channels on the rise, customer service has finally adapted to the multichannel environment. However, it still has a long way to go before it can deliver a true quality service across all channels. Do you have any doubts? Answer this simple question. &#8211; Is your customer service capable of resolving customer issues via the customer-chosen channel or does the customer have to switch channels to get their issues resolved?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6173" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/multi-channel-service.png" alt="multi-channel customer service" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/multi-channel-service.png 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/multi-channel-service-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>In most cases, the customer has to switch channels in order to get their issues resolved.  This is especially true in case their first choice of channels was IVR self-service, SMS, or social media.  When customers start with one of these channels, they are often required to make a second contact via a different channel to resolve that same problem. In most cases, it leaves them irate.</p>
<p>Here are some interesting points.  The majority of customers who start in one contact channel do not like to switch channels to resolve the same inquiry or problem. If a customer’s inquiry or problem stays unresolved and they have to contact the company again, most customers tend to go back to the initial channel they used.</p>
<p>In fact, when a second contact was needed to resolve the same inquiry or issue it is found that for the <a href="http://sqmgroup.com/one-contact-resolution-conference/">web self-service channel 79% and IVR self-service channel 81% of customers used the same channel</a>. In the majority of cases, when a customer used a different contact channel to resolve the same inquiry or problem, it was the result of the initial contact channel’s failure and not because the customer wanted to use a new channel.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Channel-distribution.jpg" alt="Channel-distribution" width="600" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6272" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Channel-distribution.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Channel-distribution-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>However, when a customer uses a second channel to resolve their issues or inquiries, the call center is by far the channel of choice. This is because the call center handles the complex inquiries and issues that the other contact channels are not capable of resolving. In addition, the model of using the same channel to resolve an inquiry is the highest with the call center channel.</p>
<p>Therefore, comparing to call center channel, most other contact channels are lagging far behind in terms of resolving critical issues. For this reason, customers still prefer contacting a company via call center channels. They know that it can offer them one contact resolution and they love call center channel for it.</p>
<p>However, not every contact channel can make customers this happy. They need to use other contact channels repeatedly to resolve their issues and even then, they often have to switch channels to get resolution. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies these days fail to provide a quality customer service experience across all channels. As a result, the customers still have to channel hop to fix woes.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we hope that this issue too will soon be resolved!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Customers have always been the king but being a customer in the present era has its own benefits. Sure, one can argue that since the beginning of business, customers were given much importance and as a result, customer service was always an important aspect of business.</p>
<p>But if you look closely, you will realize that the percentage of business owners taking interest in providing their customers with quality customer service is far greater than it previously was. in fact, during the last decade,  the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html" target="_blank">importance of customer service  has increased</a> exponentially.  Which makes us wonder, what can we expect Customer Service to become in the coming decade?</p>
<p>To find out, let’s take a quick look at the changes in the awareness level, both among the customers and the business owners alike.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to Accenture global customer satisfaction report 2008, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130604134550-284615-15-statistics-that-should-change-the-business-world-but-haven-t" target="_blank">price is not the main reason for customer churn</a>; it is actually due to the overall poor quality of customer service.</li>
<li>According to the White House Office of Consumer Affairs as reported by <a href="http://returnonbehavior.com/2010/10/50-facts-about-customer-experience-for-2011/" target="_blank">Return on Behavior</a> magazine Loyal customers are worth up to ten times as much as their first purchase.</li>
<li>70% of buying experiences are based on how the customer feels they are being treated – <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/the_moment_of_truth_in_customer_service" target="_blank">McKinsey</a>.</li>
<li>55% of customers would <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/10/customer-service-stats-55-of-consumers-would-pay-more-for-a-better-service-experience.html" target="_blank">pay extra to guarantee a better service</a> – Defaqto research.</li>
</ul>
<p>if you combine just these four stats together, you  will have no doubt that customer loyalty has  become one of the most sought after realities, to business owners, and, Customer Service is the only thing that can transform a onetime customer into a loyal one.</p>
<p>As customers are becoming more aware of their importance, more and more businesses are coming onboard giving customer service a shout out.</p>
<p>In our industry, some of the most recognizable customer service trends of the present decade include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-channel customer Service</li>
<li>Omni-channel customer service</li>
<li>IVR-Supported customer service</li>
<li>Social customer service</li>
<li>Reduction of wait time and inclusion of call back request</li>
<li>Video call customer support</li>
<li>One tap customer support</li>
</ul>
<p>With more and more businesses nodding in favor of better and more innovative customer support, we can all expect the customer service scene to change even more in the next decade.  So, let’s take a quick look at the possible trends that will still be there in the next decade:</p>
<h2><strong>Multi-Channel Customer Service will be a norm</strong></h2>
<p>With more and more businesses providing multi-channel customer service, it will cease to be deemed as a perk. By the year 2020, the multichannel customer service will become the new norm.</p>
<p><strong>The magnitude of multi-channel will also increase</strong></p>
<p>By 2020, a variety of new social media communication channels will also be included in the bevy of customer service channels. And businesses will surely connect with their customers using the most popular of these channels.</p>
<p><strong>Integration of customer data for all channels will be a reality</strong></p>
<p>In  the near  future,  we will be able to see a complete  integration  of customer data to ensure  that a customer  does not  have to repeat themselves in case they contact a business  more than once, using  different  channels.  If the customer data is stored systematically, an agent can easily take a quick look at it and understand the problem customer is facing, he or she can also suggest the customer some product, based on the purchasing preference data and thus earn a business some additional revenue. The integrated customer data will also help businesses provide a personalized customer service.</p>
<p><strong>More businesses will opt for Customer Service outsourcing</strong></p>
<p>According to a new report from the Economist Intelligence Unit titled <a href="http://www.economistinsights.com/search/node/service%202020" target="_blank">Services 2020: Megatrends</a>, 87% of participants take care of their service offering in-house.  However, in the coming decade, the demand for service provider specialists is likely to increase.</p>
<p>These are some of the  customer service  trends that will be still remain relevant in the year 2020 and  beyond.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the age of multi-channel customer service, many businesses find delivering the same quality of customer satisfaction via each available customer service channel, quite challenging.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, it is quite impossible to deliver the level of customer satisfaction that a customer gets using an age old communication channel via a channel that has been launched yesterday.</p>
<p>Also, it is quite difficult for a business to use every communication channel that is being launched.  It takes a lot of research, time, and investment to run a fully functional customer service channel that only a small fraction of your customer base uses.  Also, doing the same for every communication channel will take the focus off the customer service aspect, as well as their main service offering.  Now you wouldn’t want that to happen, would you?</p>
<p>And so, you may want to come up with a customer service channel strategy for your business.  Study the channels most of your consumers prefer and optimize them for your customer service delivery.  And when you’re unsure about whether your customers are getting a best in class quality experience from each channel,take the initiative to direct them to the right customer channel.</p>
<h3><strong> Proactive intervention</strong></h3>
<p>While a company can offer multiple service delivery channels, it is also necessary to proactively intervene and identify the channel of choice for each transaction. It helps control costs and boost revenue. For example, a customer may prefer speaking to a customer service agent rather than interacting with the IVR system. But if the IVR can handle the situation better, then a company should proactively offer consumers the choice.</p>
<h3><strong>Designing the channel architecture</strong></h3>
<p>Often companies have a vague idea of things like transaction volumes and revenue from each service channels. When it comes to the cost of service, customer preference or perceived quality of each channel, most companies do not have a clear idea. To design a strong and profitable channel architecture, a business has to segment customers based on their preferred service channel, learn the current transaction mix of each channel and its cost per activity in each channel. Analyzing the average revenue realizations and customer loyalty level for each channel might also be a good idea.</p>
<p>Data analysis, at a granular level, is an essential step in creating channel architecture for a multi-channel service organization.  Cost, revenue and customer preference often play important roles in this.  Fusion believes, analyzing the data the right way may lead a business to find cross-sales opportunities, and ways to control the cost without affecting <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/start-by-keeping-your-customers-happy.html">customer satisfaction</a> levels.</p>
<h3><strong> Incentivize the right choice</strong></h3>
<p>One of the best ways to encourage customers to migrate from one channel to another is to incentivize the right choice. Incentives include a positive benefit (discounts or improved customer service) associated with the right channel and a negative effect (additional fees or late service) linked with the other channels for a particular transaction.  For example, a telecom company that wants its customers to use their IVR system will offer IVR option first when someone calls its customer care number and talking to a live agent will cost them money.</p>
<p>In some situations, companies may need to guide special groups of customer to special channels for the same transaction. For example, a credit card company may let its platinum level customers communicate directly with a customer service representative while all the other customers have to navigate through an IVR menu before they can speak to an agent.</p>
<p>Companies may also incentivize their staff when they help customers choose the right channel.</p>
<h3><strong> Change management</strong></h3>
<p>Successful channel migration is possible through a well planned “change management” strategy. There are three things to take into account to ensure that the channel migration is smooth:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li><strong>Timing it Right:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It is easier to introduce a new channel when the demand is strong or when your existing channel is overcrowded. Try to offer some continuity to your customers to help them migrate easily to the new channel. For example, if you used telesales and now want to move to chat; using the same persons for chat support for the initial week is a good idea.  Fusion points out that it will not only offer continuity but also will help you keep the cost in check. Fusion always <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/new-year-resolutions-by-our-call-center-agents-for-2015.html">cross-trains</a> its agents to aid its clients when they introduce a new channel for service.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Reducing the Risk of Failure:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Once the channel migration strategy is in place, a company needs to ensure that there are adequate provisions such as training and pilots to reduce the risk of failure. For example, if they are not satisfied with the new channel the customers may want the option to switch back to the old ones. Training the staff and customers will dramatically reduce the chance of failure.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Communicating the Change:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If a company manages to create a buzz around a new channel highlighting its advantages, the customers are more likely to use it. This can be done either through media advertisement the existing service channel. For example, by having your email support service ask the customer, “<em>Have you tried our chat for customer support? It is twice as fast.</em>”  Client testimonials may also create a buzz.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If look up “<em>Call center best practices</em>” on the web, you will come across thousands of article telling you exactly the same things – determining goals, hiring the right people, training and  motivating them, understanding the metrics and  so on and  so forth.  All these are very important. But there is also another perspective of determining best practices.</p>
<p>Let us put it this way, all we do in a call center is to interact with our client’s customers and potential customers.  So, shouldn’t their perspective be taken into consideration?  Do contact center managers listen to the customers’ needs, wants and thoughts?</p>
<p>Marketing guru <a href="http://www.1to1media.com/speaking/view.aspx?itemid=33603" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Martha Rogers</a> have summed up customer expectation beautifully in one line-</p>
<p>“<em>People want what they want when they want it</em>.”</p>
<p>Being the lifeline of a business, your customers, should be the first one you should think of when considering best practices. As per a benchmark research report by <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/consumers-lovehate-relationship-with-contact-centers-144866375.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ForeSee</a>, that states the impact customer satisfaction has on success of a call center</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly satisfied consumers are 174% more likely to make contact again than less satisfied customers</li>
<li>They are 154% more likely to purchase next time</li>
<li>238% more likely to recommend the company to friends and family members</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it means that a call center is more likely to succeed if they exceed customer expectations.  And how exactly can they do it? Let’s find out:</p>
<h2>Top 3 Customer Inspired Best Practices for the Contact Center</h2>
<h3><strong>1. Share Information:</strong></h3>
<p>Customers get irritated when information given to the IVR (such as -account number, name, etc.) is lost once their call is transferred to an agent. And they have to repeat the information.  This issue also takes place in case of a multichannel call center.</p>
<p>When a customer switches communication channels, their information provided to the previous channel do not get carried away to the new channel, and they have to provide the information once again.  Now that is surely frustrating.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with more and more call center turning Omni-channel, this problem will soon be a thing of past. In case of <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/deliver-optimum-customer-experience-within-an-omni-channel-strategy.html">Omni-channel</a> call center, the information provided to a channel will seamlessly transfer to another channel along with other related data to another channel when a customer switches the channel.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Better IVR Experience:</strong></h3>
<p>Is your IVR system so complicated that the customers have to shoot arrows in the dark to reach a live agent? If yes, then you are doing it wrong. A complicated IVR is not the right way to treat your customers.  It makes the callers feel frustrated and minimizes the customers chance to get a quick solution to their problems.</p>
<p>In case the customer is calling using a smartphone app or web widget, a business can always give them the opportunity of visual IVR.  This will allow the customers to navigate at their own pace and find out what they want and then contact the concerned department.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Eliminate Hold Time:</strong></h3>
<p>Long hold time is often detrimental to customer satisfaction. It makes the customer feel that their time is not respected. This upsets them.  And when they reach an agent, they are already cranky and irritable.  So, even a minor issue can trigger an outburst at that time.</p>
<p>Giving the customers an option to get a call-back can be a possible solution to the problem. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-ways-a-call-center-can-benefit-using-virtual-queuing.html">Virtual queuing</a> them the option of a scheduled call-back and allow callers select a time that works best for them.  This way, you can eliminate hold time and make customers happy.</p>
<p>These are some possible solutions to some of the most crucial call center issues from the perspective of the customers. Thankfully, these issues can be avoided with a little change in the way call centers deal with each customer.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often marketers browses various Whitepapers, attends different webinars to know which trends or approaches can let them bring changes in their annual scorecard/bottom-line.</p>
<p>Exchanging notes with the industry experts and the leading entrepreneurs, marketers have started to share their non-core tasks to offshore partners.</p>
<p>As opting for contact centers is a dubious and strategic move, many leaders used to stay away from offshoring due to conventional fears.</p>
<p>In present day, however, many have given up their fears and have started to use outsourcing as a tactic to make reliable profits. In a previous blog, we have shown how Asset Managers of today <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/resolving-assetwealth-management-conundrums-with-next-generation-outsourcing.html" target="_blank">overcame their limitations</a> and chose outsourcing as a strategic tool to cut down on cost and bring change in the service levels.</p>
<p>Now the question is &#8211; How an outsourcing partner can help business to make profitable shifts in their bottom-line. What futuristic approaches are making contact center help business to expand their customer base?</p>
<p>Fusion is going to share three big contact center futuristic trends that will help B2B and B2C clients irrespective of their business size to produce a strong chain of customer and grow a rock-solid scorecard.</p>
<h3>Customer Expectation Going to Rise and That’s a Positive Trait</h3>
<p>In a business, we need to grow our foresight and speculate what might happen next. With excellent customer service from notable vendors, consumer now wants to receive similar treatment from every business or services in nooks and corners of the world. It does not matter whether you are a utility service or a technical support.</p>
<p>When a customer knocks your business, he or she comes predetermined about receiving a higher-level service. With the in-house agents, you cannot accomplish this service goal as they miss the desired skills to provide top-notch customer support.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a contact center can offer your customers a supreme level of customer service.</p>
<p>Some latest features such as customer giving call backs or having Live Video Chat/WebChat with respective agents are simply amazing. It serves your business with real-time benefits. Often, it is hard to equip your in-house agents with state-of-the-art business tools, as they are expensive.</p>
<p>A contact center is always ready to initiate any kind of marketing campaign. So, leveraging your services to contact centers is going to apprehend business goals and will be cost saving.</p>
<p>A good futuristic point that makes a contact center unique from in-house teams is that – <em>contact center people knows what drives a better customer experience.</em></p>
<h3>Communications Using More Than One Channel</h3>
<p>With the use of contact center, a business can eventually increase their customer base just not locally or nationally, but globally. How is it possible? It is simply because call centers offer exposure to your business through a number of channels.</p>
<p>According to the recent study, 77 percent of the customer prefers to use multi-channel in order to seek a service. Hence, the key ingredient is to keep your customer happy and offer them with supports in the real-time.</p>
<p>As said earlier, consumers, today, prefer to use more than one channel. They use a set of new channels such as phone, email, web-based chat, SMS, social media, click to call, screen sharing, etc. This shows that arrays of online digital channels are popular among customers.</p>
<p>It is tricky enough to understand how different types of customer use different channels to seek services. Hence, it is essential for your business to consider <a href="http://bigdoor.com/blog/2013/11/01/a-quick-guide-to-customer-journey-mapping/" target="_blank">customer journey mapping</a>. However, do you have the time to initiate the mapping? If not, contact centers are ready to help you.</p>
<p>How do contact centers help to expand your customer base? How contact centers steer the communication channels to generate positive customer perspective?</p>
<ul>
<li>They move with a definite goal based on you company services and undertakings</li>
<li>Helps your business to decide up on the key points that makes or breaks a relationship with your customer</li>
<li>They involve everyone a prospective customer, or an irate customer, even the one-time or seasonal buyers</li>
</ul>
<h3>Live Agents Offer fresh Lease of Life in Customer Service</h3>
<p>When it comes to customer service, the live conversation via Live Chat or Video Chat has a large role to play. With the rise in self-service options, the quantity of transactions over the live conversation channels is less, but there are instances when the self-services fall short. This make the live agents more focused.</p>
<p>In popular surveys, we find that depending on the nature of the inquiry customer prefers to use the channels. For simple inquiries such as, “<em>What’s My Balance?</em>”, “<em>What’s The Status of My Shipment?</em>” online self-serve help and email are the clear winners.</p>
<p>However, when the inquiry is complex such as a failure in the technical aspects or may be a failure in the order supply, “<em>live agents</em>” are the dominant choice.</p>
<p>Contact centers utilize the Live Chat channels in the most refined manner. They make it viable by –</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilizing the best resources and identifying the key opportunities for chat to analyze website data and customer feedback</li>
<li>Personalizes the interaction that your in-house agents often fail to initiate</li>
<li>They escalate the service to voice when it matter for your business.</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as you leverage the customer support to an outsourcing partner, you will be able to open to viable options of expanding your customer base. Your business will be exposed to a larger demographic, and you will observe a steady escalation in your ROI.</p>
<h3>What Customer’s Feel About Your Business, From the Desk of Fusion –</h3>
<p>At Fusion, we have worked with a number of B2B and B2C companies, who outsource their customer support simply not to expand, but to make their customer “<em>keep coming back</em>.” In these 9 years, we have learned that the customers like someone to take care of them when they need the assistance.</p>
<p>With contact centers such as Fusion, it is possible to attain your customer almost 24/7/6365 days that too in real time with real assistance.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we have realized that positive and happy customers are the keys to unlock reliable profits for companies, irrespective of B2B or B2C.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fusion BPO Services has made the move. They have taken steps sometimes back to change their ordinary call center into a multi-channel call center. However, in the beginning, the change seemed to be a bit overwhelming, but none says that to acquire good things you need to walk on smooth roads.</p>
<p>How will a standard call center change into a multi-channel call center? Here, we are going to share three bragging tips to give your call center a competitive edge.</p>
<p>What did Fusion do to transform their call center? Here, we will find the steps Fusion took to introduce the new look to solve customer problems in an upright manner.</p>
<p>Let us glide through the three tips to see how Fusion has moved with the change.</p>
<h3>TIP 1: Engage the Channel That Your Customers Use the Most</h3>
<p>You will find a number of channels, but you should use the one that your customer prefers to use the most. If you are not certain, ask your agents like the way we do at Fusion.</p>
<p>Agents are the frontline hence they have a considerable exposure to the customers that lead to their insights, which we have utilized.</p>
<p>We discussed every move of the new channel with our agents and involved them in the process. They are part of the successful implementation of the multiple channels at Fusion.</p>
<h3>TIP 2: Have a Structured Plan and Fit in with Appropriate Agents</h3>
<p>As soon as you select the channel to deliver your services, you need to draw out a plan to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which type of channel will you like to implement at your workstation?</li>
<li>Number of agents will be required.</li>
<li>The guidelines you need for the new channel.</li>
<li>What should be the length of the campaign?</li>
<li>Results that you want to generate at the end of the campaign.</li>
<li>How will you measure the results generated?</li>
</ul>
<p>The most determining part here is the agents whom you select to steer the campaigns and will get determined by the type of channel you choose.</p>
<p>For example, at Fusion when we think about testing chat based services we look out for the millennial agents because chatting is a medium where Gen X and Gen Y (millennial) can jam up pretty well.</p>
<p>Make sure that the agents you choose for the multi-channel platform have a strong email writing skills and can scribble down mails and text that are more customer-oriented.</p>
<h3>TIP 3: Time to Implement the Plan and Evaluate</h3>
<p>When you think to implement the plan, start gathering feedback. If a part of your campaign is stuck, do make changes in the fly. It’s time to listen to your agents. The right team will give you clear and concise feedback on, what is working and what is not. How are you going to fix the improper things?</p>
<p>Ask for agents suggestions. Document the results to have a clear picture on the campaign success. After you compile the results generated, you will be able to determine whether or not the channel installed meet your needs.</p>
<p>These are the general tips that will tell you to reconstruct your general call center into a multi-channel user. In order to stay ahead in business, we have to move with the trend.</p>
<p>Equip your call center with the best customer service channel to shoot up the positive customer satisfaction rate.</p>
