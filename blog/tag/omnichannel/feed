<p>In this competitive age, good customer
experience holds the key to customer loyalty.&nbsp;
In order to provide a good experience, businesses must focus on
delivering exceptional customer support that meets, if not overcomes your
customer’s expectations. </p>



<p>Customers today are exposed to the gold
standard of customer service. They are aware of their options and the power
they have. Therefore, they have high expectations from a business.</p>



<h2>So, What Does Your Customer Want?</h2>



<p>They want a company to promptly respond to
their queries and issues via the channel of their choice.&nbsp; If they wish to change the communication
channel, they should be able to do so seamlessly without having to repeat
themselves. </p>



<p>Today most of the companies provide customer support via a number of channels including <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/voice.html">voice</a>, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">chat</a>, email, social media, instant messaging, web, and mobile. However, the challenge is to integrate those channels for providing seamless interaction with consistent experience at multiple touch-points across the life cycle of a customer.  Such a feat is only achievable by adopting an omnichannel approach. </p>



<p>Fusion advocates <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="omnichannel customer support (opens in a new tab)">omnichannel customer support</a> to provide customers with a cohesive and integrated customer experience irrespective of where and how a customer chooses to reach you. Omnichannel customer support brings you a number of benefits. Here are the top benefits of adopting omnichannel customer support.</p>



<h2>Benefits of Omnichannel Customer Support &#8211;</h2>



<h3>1. Gain Greater Customer Insights</h3>



<p>Customer support channels such as chat, social media, forums, and emails, leave a recorded written customer trace. You can use this data to accumulate customer information in its context. It will help you better understand how the customers choose to interact with your brand and their needs across all channels.</p>



<p>Having this data in one place will enable you to take proactive actions and create effective strategies to tweak and enhance your customer support and deliver better customer experience.</p>



<h3>2. Serve Your Customers Where They Are</h3>



<p>Customers today want to make purchases on their own terms, at their convenience, and in a way that suits them the best. To build a sustainable business, you must satisfy your customers. That means you have to appeal to them wherever they are.</p>



<p>No matter what channel they choose to interact with you, you must provide seamless, cohesive support via the same. If the customer wishes to change their channel, they should be able to continue with the conversation across the channel as well.</p>



<p>Customers today are more powerful and aware
of the options they have. Therefore, they expect more from brands.&nbsp; They expect to get the best experience
wherever they are — whether online or offline. Providing it to them will not
only improve your conversion rate but will also increase a customer’s loyalty.</p>



<h3>3. Enhance the Shopping Experience Everywhere</h3>



<p>Your customer can choose to shop online,
in-app, or in a brick and mortar store, and still expect the same level of
customer experience. </p>



<p>For example – a customer looks for a product he has seen online at a brick and mortar store and the in-store representative finds the product out of stock.  He can then place an order for the same in their e-commerce store, to be delivered at the customer&#8217;s doorstep. </p>



<p>This way, omnichannel customer support can
enhance the shopping experience.</p>



<h3>4. Enhance Real-time Customer Support</h3>



<p>As customers’ demands are increasing by the day, businesses are making efforts to meet them. Customers want their needs to be met and they want it now. If you cannot deliver a real-time answer to their questions, or provide instant support, you are indirectly asking them to leave.</p>



<p>Real-time customer support boost customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. With <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-omnichannel-customer-service-best-practices-to-boost-customer-experience.html">omnichannel customer support</a>, it is possible to offer real-time support across a number of channels, creating a seamless customer experience.</p>



<h3>5. Happier, More Engaged and Loyal Customer</h3>



<p>When you have omnichannel customer support in place, your customers will be able to switch between channels seamlessly without feeling the frustration of having to repeat the issues. Also having up-to-date data in one place means faster resolution of issues. Such things definitely add to customer satisfaction rate and result in happier customers. Everyone knows that a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/start-by-keeping-your-customers-happy.html">happy customer</a> is the greatest thing for a business.</p>



<p>These are the vital benefits of adopting an omnichannel approach when it comes to customer service. By adopting an omnichannel approach you can enhance your customer experience, stay ahead of the competition with impeccable customer service, earn loyal and engaged customers who keep coming back, improving your business performance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;In today’s highly
competitive customer service industry, customers are more demanding and
powerful than before. They are also more knowledgeable and tech-savvy than
ever. Therefore, to impress them and keep their business, you need to have
impeccable customer service with omnichannel and consistent support. </p>



<p>Today the best-in-class companies deliver consistent
messages to customers across all channels and a majority of customers dislike
repeating their queries. So, at present, omnichannel customer service is the
key to meeting customer expectation and even surpassing it. Here are 5
omnichannel customer service tips that can help you get started: </p>



<h3>1. Focus on
mobile-based service</h3>



<p>&nbsp;In 2019, not being
able to offer uncompromised support via mobile is not only unacceptable but
also self-sabotaging for a business.&nbsp; In
a time when <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/shopping-lists-how-mobile-helps-consumers-tick-all-the-boxes.html">87%</a>
of customers actually use mobile devices to make purchases, businesses must
insist on having a quality mobile-based customer service in place. Or else they
must face the wrath of their frustrated customers.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Here’s how you can improve your customer service via mobile:</p>



<ul><li>Provide your customers with mobile-friendly
FAQs, documentation and self-support videos.</li><li>Your mobile website/app landing page must
display your customer service button prominently.</li><li>Give your customer an easy way to contact
customer support from the mobile. It can be prominent, but non-intrusive
dial-for-support or live-chat-for-support button that lets them communicate
with you without leaving the page. </li><li>Single-tap sensitive customer service links are
preferable.</li><li>A real-time tracking system for mobile-based
customer service queries is also important.</li></ul>



<h3>2. Reduce your social
media response time</h3>



<p>Customers today are fond of instant resolutions.&nbsp; That is why they prefer social media
platforms (especially Twitter) to catch the attention of companies and have
them resolve customer service issues promptly.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-research/42-percent-of-consumers-complaining-in-social-media-expect-60-minute-response-time/">study</a>,
42% of the participants said they expected companies to respond to social media
mentions within 60 minutes.&nbsp; </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Social-customer-support.jpg" alt="social customer support" class="wp-image-6387" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Social-customer-support.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Social-customer-support-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<p>Here’s how to do it:</p>



<ul><li>Understand your customers’ expectations when
they post their queries on social media, anticipate their needs and then
address their concerns.</li><li>Aim to respond to all queries within the first
60 minutes.&nbsp; Even if you cannot offer a
solution in that time frame, acknowledging the issue and assuring the customer
of a response can go a long way.&nbsp; </li><li>Set up keyword tracking for your social media
pages and never miss any customer’s comments.</li><li>Provide seamless customer support by integrating
social media with live chat.</li></ul>



<h3>3. Offer live chat
assistance for priority customers</h3>



<p>Every business needs to prioritize their enterprise and
high-level customers and therefore must offer the quick-resolve routes that
present the least hassles. In these cases, a face-to-face call or live chat can
be their best aid to boost customer experience.</p>



<p>According to a Forrester <a href="https://www.ama.org/documents/how-b2b-marketers-leveraging-live-chat-increase-sales.pdf">study</a>,
interactive chat can result in as much as a 120% ROI in a 6-month payback
period. </p>



<p>How to use live chat assistance to keep priority customers
happy</p>



<ul><li>Install a reliable live chat on your website and
app across devices.</li><li>Create a flexible script with room for
improvisation as per the customer’s needs. A list of conversation points can be
helpful too. </li><li>Use a CRM to store important information about
customers that you can refer to for context before attending a customer’s call.</li><li>Keep product manuals and resources ready to send
across to your customers when required during your call.</li><li>Allow customers to lead the call with their
requirements but do not allow them to deviate from the topic.</li></ul>



<h3>4. Enable self-service
via easy-to-use FAQs and documentation</h3>



<p>According to a Zendesk <a href="http://cdn.zendesk.com/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf">study</a>,
50% of customers want to resolve their issues by themselves, without having to involve
a customer support team. They cost your customer service team the least and
turn better cost-to-profit ratios. Such customers can be satiated with
self-serve FAQs, documentation and video content.</p>



<p>How to create optimized FAQs and documentation</p>



<ul><li>Make your FAQs comprehensive, organized, and
easy to navigate.</li><li>A/B test for your FAQ and documentation landing
pages and optimize for the best design and ease-of-use. </li><li>Create excellent copy that offers an excellent
self-service experience. </li></ul>



<h3>5. Set up an email
automation workflow</h3>



<p>Email should be part of your customer service system. It’s
easy to manage, still effective and can resolve a good number of your
customers’ queries. And with CRMs that offer email automation workflows, email
customer service has become an easy to manage customer service channel. </p>



<p>How to use email automation workflows to enable flawless
customer service</p>



<ul><li>Keep your automation workflows under frequent
checks, and tweak email drafts and automation schedules as and when required. </li><li>Use an actual email for replies so your
customers feel cared for and can interact with your automated messages.</li><li>If you resolve common issues in a completely
automated fashion, you will only have to take care of any unusual activity as
and when they occur.</li></ul>



<p>These are a few ways you can improve customer experience through multichannel communication. The key to success of a customer service system, omnichannel, multichannel, or otherwise, lies in the proper understanding of what the customer wants and needs, empathizing with them, and delivering prompt resolution with a bit of personal touch.  Even with the right technology, a customer service system is sure to fail if it cannot feel the pain points of your customers and empathize with them.</p>



<p>A healthy dose of empathy, personalization, and prompt resolution at the right time through the right channel can give a good boost customer experience and earn your business some loyal customers. </p>
