								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finances are the eminent part of your business, and they are the sole connector to achieve and clear and accurate picture of your business. Whatever may be the size of your business – small or large, you have to ensure that all financial transactions get recorded accurately and enables you to take informed decisions based on the solid data.</p>
<p>Fusion has brought out the popular reason why popular companies like to outsource their financial transaction to offshore contact centers. Is it just cost affordability and flexibility or something more?</p>
<h3>#1. Time Is Valuable &amp; Time Is Money</h3>
<p>Many business owners do their bookkeeping at their own as they are not having enough to hire a bookkeeper to do the job. No matter whatever may be the size of your business, you should be spending your time doing that in which you are the best and that’s: <b>Running Your Business!</b></p>
<p>Do consider hiring an efficient, well-trained, skillful outsourced bookkeeper to keep up with the bookkeeping needs. It may be once per week, or once per month, an outsourced bookkeeper is able to provide books and maintains accurate records on which you can work upon anytime without hampering your core business aspects.</p>
<h3>#2. Get the Satisfaction</h3>
<p>We know how stressful it is to run a business – you do not need to add pressure of wondering if the books are accurate or whether the bills are paid on time. An outsourced bookkeeper will help you alleviate the stress. Do you face trouble while preparing the budgets? Do you need help in strategic planning? Don’t you think that will be a smoother if you get the assistance of a CFO? With the help of a CFO, you can browse through different options that you might have taken while deciding upon major decisions.</p>
<h3>#3. Stay Consistent</h3>
<p>There are businesses that use untrained employees to do the books say for part-time basis and often concluded that the records are incomplete and inconsistent. These irregularities are often very confusing and can multiply over time. It makes hard for you to get an accurate financial of your company. An outsourced bookkeeper can work with you and can develop procedures helps you to develop the process, and procedures tailored to your business so that you can get a refined picture of your business.</p>
<h3>#4. Cost Affordability</h3>
<p>The key to unlock the profits in business is efficient financial management. You need to have an accurate record of the financial transactions that will help you to take further decisions. It may be expensive, and at times, you feel that it is unnecessary to hire a full-time bookkeeper, Controller or CFO. However, your business needs one of them, but not all of them at a time. Outsourced financial professional at Fusion does them as per your needs. You just pay only for the task that you need your outsourcers to do on behalf of you.</p>
<h3>#5. Get Flexibility Over Transactions</h3>
<p>Some of the common situation, which often business owners face:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a seasonal business thus needs extra helping hands during the busy season.</li>
<li>Bookkeeper going on a vacation thus needs a replacement.</li>
<li>Financial controller quitted suddenly and thus financial management goes sunken.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all above situation outsourcing, your financial services to an outsourced call center are the solution. What you get with the outsourced partner like Fusion:</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, India as a BPO industry has some distinct advantages, and it has helped them for a decade to climb the dominant position. At present India is holding the topmost position in the global BPO market, capturing all revenue, shares, and exports. If we consider India’s position back in the 1980’s when IT infrastructure has just launched their session, we will witness a vast change. At that time, China was India’s chief rival and India was much behind them when it comes to English-speaking workforce and IT infrastructure. However, the global market saw the potential of BPO growth in India in the future. India has climbed the ladder of success despite meeting challenges in the global BPO market. Some of the prominent challenges include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A poor business environment that does not facilitate IT BPO growth in India</li>
<li>High tax rates and government support were quite less</li>
<li>Issue of Indian accents since most of the processes were voice-based services</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it is year 2013, Fusion BPO Services a leading IT BPO company in India is going to show through this write up, that’s how well India can retain the BPO Edge in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>We know that the Indian BPO Industry has matured a lot. We have that skilled workforce whom we have trained in various outsourcing model and have given them the scope to understand the entire cycle of outsourcing. You have so many regions who have started to invest in the BPO industry and are giving a tough compete to India.</p>
<p>In the midst of this situation, a big question strikes the mind of almost all – will it be possible for India to retain their BPO popularity? Will the outsourcers continue to choose India as their favorite destination? Well, Fusion gives thumbs up and says that India will continue to grow in the near future. Well we have 5 reasons to support our viewpoint.</p>
<h3>#1 Outsourcing Skills to Drive India towards Rising Growth</h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.sourcingline.com/" target="_blank">SourcingLine</a>, who compiled a global BPO database comprising all the key statistics like &#8211; competitiveness, resources and skills and business environment. Considering all the factors India emerged as the most popular and preferred BPO destination with an overall outsourcing index of 7.1 and other outsourcing destinations that follow India are &#8211; Indonesia (6.9), China (6.4), Bulgaria (6.4), and Philippines (6.3)</p>
<p>If you consider the individual index scores for the above three key criteria, India follows behind some destinations or leads them just by a few score, this includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>China has an index score of 6 as the nearest resource and skills competitor whereas India is at 5.6.</li>
<li>Philippines hit the index score of 9 with reference to cost competitiveness and India follows it at 8.3.</li>
<li>China score 6 at the index for business environment, and India is at 4.2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>#2 Reworking on the Disadvantages</h3>
<p>We know that the global outsourcing trends keep on changing. For this changing trend, the competing nation tries hard to turn their disadvantages to advantages. Well, if it is so, then we will say reworking on the disadvantages is a hard task. It is not possible for India to improve their business index faster than China. Neither India nor China can offer competitive cost like the Philippines. However, we keep our finger crossed to achieve the basic limit of BPO service excellence in the near future reworking on this key features.</p>
<h3>#3 Low Wages Make It a Deliberate Choice</h3>
<p>Costs are the most crucial thing and the determinant factor for the rise and the growth of a BPO region. Offshore outsourcing aims to save the wages. It is the low wages which are paid to the junior resources to cut the companies cost. People like the IT engineers and web developers in India are hired at 11% the cost of those in US, according to the data provided by <a href="http://www.sourcingline.com/outsourcing-location/india" target="_blank">SourcingLine</a>. Indian staffs in the senior levels get 30% of their wages of what their US counterparts get. It helps businesses to save wages by offering business processes to India.</p>
<h3>#4 Real Estate and Tax Costs are Getting BPO Savvy</h3>
<p>You have many other factors that help BPO to reduce cost, like that of infrastructure cost. However, it eventually does not save a lot for the BPO buyers as the prices of infrastructure keeps on shifting with increasing demand. Real estate costs generally vary with location. Many prime BPO destinations in India are there whose commercial spaces are sold at much higher price than New York. Even at times corporate taxes are unsupportive. However, the white paper released by the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/working_papers/ec200601a.pdf" target="_blank">US International Trade Commission</a> shows that tax benefits are trying to keep parallel with BPO after the 2013 budget and the real estate price are falling down to suit the global BPO market.</p>
<h3>#5 Market Share and Sector Size are High</h3>
<p>BPO industry accounts only 1% of the India’s GDP and less than 2% of its annual job creation. According to the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1666514" target="_blank">Gartner</a> Research, India at present accounts 39% of the world share in outsourcing business. Whereas India generates 40% revenue from the software and accounts, 70% of its total business exports services. NASSCOM reported that from 2002 to 2008 revenues of India has increased from 40% to 44% and it will continue to grow after 2012. Well, if we calculate the total revenue India BPO generates, we will see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>70% revenue comes from call centers</li>
<li>20% from the high and low volume data works</li>
<li>Remaining 10% comes from the high- value added functions</li>
</ul>
<p>India has been witnessing this steady growth in BPO sector since 2008. Well, it does have some prominent reasons like –</p>
<ul>
<li>Declining telecommunication rates</li>
<li>Low labor costs</li>
<li>New interactive software</li>
<li>Project management skills</li>
<li>Availability of skilled, educated and English-speaking labor pool</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the basic 5 reason, which throws limelight on the BPO growth in India. Fusion BPO services say that India will retain their BPO image for a long time due to their keen sense of boosting those services what they do best. India is going to have a close look at the competitors to improve their business environment, cost and resources in order to redefine their business.</p>

[&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Possible features you see in a project during pre-launch:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The provider’s sales team has gone away</i></li>
<li><i>All the site visits have been conducted</i></li>
<li><i>The contract has been fastened</i></li>
</ul>
<p>After having a smooth transition, now it is your time to put the offshore delivery and support to test how they can meet all your business demands. In this new outsourcing environment, <i>how will you know that the objective of your business is achieved? Has your service provider managed the goals successfully?</i></p>
<p>When it comes to outsourcing, two things are most prominent &#8211; <i>people and their skills</i>. The delivery teams are given incentives to control the cost of the people. With the use of certain basic rules, these rules help to examine whether the objectives of the offshore team will align with your business goals or not.</p>
<p>Here are some of the criteria that bring success with the help of an offshore delivery team and their management. We adhere to these metrics at Fusion to allow our clients to have a better share of profits.</p>
<h3>ROI (Return on Investment)</h3>
<p>It is not just the sales and the account team who are given the objective to achieve the big ROI &#8211;  this is also a responsibility of the delivery team. You have large goals to achieve. Efficiency and lower cost are the objectives that your offshore partner has to achieve for you. At Fusion, we look into the cost and quality of our service so that clients get better solutions.</p>
<h3>Gross Limits</h3>
<p>This is the second objective that has an impact on the team behavior and controls the resourcing decisions for platforms like &#8211; onshore vs. offshore, dedicated vs. uncommitted, in scope vs. out of scope. It comes to play when you have limited contractual opportunities, and the additional revenue will be billed.</p>
<h3>ROI Earned Per Hour Worked</h3>
<p>ROI earned per hour of work is such a metric that is put to use by the outsourcing channels to control the scope given to their team. So, that they can deploy shadow resources in business process or draw the basic support from the various Centers of Excellence. Unless the contact center is contractually bound to maintain a percentage of shadow resources.</p>
<p>The contact center team is given incentives just to get the minimum need to make sure that they do not lose billing through unexpected expenses.</p>
<h3>Utilization on the Bills</h3>
<p>This is related to ROI generated per hour of work, and maintain the proactive nature of the delivery team during  &#8211; hiring, training, having a bunch of resources which can be later put to use to fight back issues of attrition or to have an expansion. Fusion makes the effective use of the bills to meet your goals and provide the service at an affordable rate.</p>
<h3>Cost Per Hour</h3>
<p>It is calculated on behalf of the entire contact center team who is involved in the process. If it is lower, it becomes easier for the team to achieve their goals.</p>
<h3>Number and Type of Team Members</h3>
<p>It is obvious that the delivery teams must have a specified number of members. These metrics run contrary to the pre-outsourcing. Previously, people with many years of experience carried out the transaction and now they are replaced by the resources. At Fusion, we avoid the conflicting client objectives and maintain a smooth transition by standardizing the process to minimize the need for the experts.</p>
<h3>Satisfying the Clients</h3>
<p>One of the main objectives on which Fusion focuses a lot. Yes, we are talking about “<em>client satisfaction</em>”. This objective is in the perfect accord with clients&#8217; goals. It is something like the tightrope, on which our delivery teams balance themselves. We have automated systems to gather reports on client satisfaction data. This forms the key element to ensure growth of the business and a way to demonstrate the specific vertical.</p>
<p>If your business has made a shift from the pre-outsourcing to an offshore environment, then you have to recognize the ways to have suitable changes that actually takes place behind the scenes but managing the relationship is due to the outcomes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The natural calamities like &#8211; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/27/chile-haiti-earthquake-co_n_479705.html" target="_blank">Haiti and Chile earthquakes</a>, floods in United States have taken a steady rise across the boundaries of the world since 2010. It has resulted the businesses to incur immense loss, and a large number of fatalities.</p>
<p>With the attack of the natural calamities, the settlement claims of the insurance firms and the spike in calls has increased excessively. The insurance company gets totally lost in the huge cloud of calls. Hence, they search an effective system to ensure that the claims are settled without any further delay. Not only claim settlement managing the irate customers, they need someone to entertain all the calls instead of abandoning  them.</p>
<p>It is some kind of risk of the financial loss that the insurance firms face at these situations along with their reputation loss.</p>
<p>What could be the most effective ways for the insurance companies to handle the grievance of the customers during natural calamities? – Choose an “Outsourcing” partner, in order to reduce the risk in company’s reputation.</p>
<p>You have both onshore and offshore outsourcing company. But offshore is more efficient since, during calamities the onshore BPO partners becomes unable to engage with customers so offshore outsourcing is more reliable and affordable. Apart from handling calls what does outsourcing do?</p>
<p>Do you know what does outsourcing actually mean? Check out the full form of <strong>O-U-T-S-O-U-R-C-I-N-G</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>O</b>&#8211; Optimal</li>
<li><b>U</b>&#8211; Unique</li>
<li><b>T</b>&#8211; Team effort</li>
<li><b>S</b>&#8211; Seamless service</li>
<li><b>O</b>&#8211; Organized</li>
<li><b>U</b>&#8211; Ubiquitous</li>
<li><b>R</b>&#8211; Relevant sales</li>
<li><b>C</b>&#8211; Competitive results</li>
<li><b>I</b>&#8211; Impromptu agents</li>
<li><b>N</b>&#8211; Notable</li>
<li><b>G</b>&#8211; Goal-achiever</li>
</ul>
<p>During the catastrophe BPO leaders like Fusion tends to provide unparalleled services like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce in the recruitment, hiring and training of agents</li>
<li>Increased focus on core competencies</li>
<li>Decrease in operating expenses</li>
<li>Utilizing modern technologies, expertise and skills in regard to claim processing</li>
<li>Enhanced customer satisfaction</li>
<li>Increase in revenue growth</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the companies do have their own <a class="zem_slink" title="Business continuity planning" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Business Continuity Plan</a> (BCP) in place, but they lack the catastrophe management program. They do not have the blueprint to handle the catastrophe. At Fusion, we provide our clients with an action plan, to handle the customer efficiently during calamities. We utilize our talent pool to manage the calls at insurance companies and minimize the problems of the end-customer.</p>
<p>We serve our client insurance companies not only by generating by generating quality leads, but during the financial loss, we help them with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-trained resources to manage the spike in calls</li>
<li>Additional hour of protection due to the catastrophe</li>
<li>Support the company with assistance staffs to manage the increased call traffic</li>
<li>Monitoring the incoming call pattern</li>
</ul>
<p>A catastrophe is the real test of an insurance company to see, how they can sustain an effective customer support despite a huge spike. It is essential for the organization to meet the challenges and hold back their reputation. So here an outsourcing partner comes to play a vital role.</p>
<p>Being the leader in the outsourcing industry, Fusion says that having an action plan is must. Insurance companies need to act, synchronize and achieve customer goals even in the catastrophe with reliable outsourcing solutions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Cut corners” and “increase the bottom line” are the two essential needs for every entrepreneur. To fulfill their goals at the minimum cost, business owners always keep searching for opportunities. Anxiety and stress are the common aspect that strikes every businessperson.</p>
<p>Outsourcing is the answer to entrepreneurs to bring down the cost without sacrificing much in executing related business process. However, this may be the reason why businesspersons become anxious as some of the processes will no longer be handled in-house.</p>
<p>Take a close look on the 5 ways to keep down the anxiety and enjoy all the benefits of outsourcing.</p>
<h3>1) Classify the Scope of Work</h3>
<p>When you engage with the outsourcing companies, it pays to have a scope of work. That is a statement or list of things that you want to be done. Before you think to head towards any kind of endeavor, outsourcing companies have their rules of engagement laid out to avoid finger pointing when a problem crops up.</p>
<p>Inform the outsourcing provider about your upfront requirements. Set the realistic expectations and put up metrics in place, which the outsourcing partner needs to hit.</p>
<h3>2) Do Not Choose On The Basis Of Price</h3>
<p>It is quite tempting, but to choose outsourcing services based on price is a big anxiety generator. You should not consider the price as the sole concern in picking a service provider. In order to buy the services of an outsourcing company, choose them on the basis of a wide variety of spectrums. You should try to maintain the balance between value and quality.</p>
<p>Price is the worst thing to consider, when you opt for a BPO company. Think of ways by which your outsourcing partner can cut costs and make the contract feasible.</p>
<h3>3) Check The Experience Of The Outsourcing Partner</h3>
<p>Look for an outsourcing provider with an excellent background on the business process in which you deal. Choose the partner who will generate quality outputs for you. At Fusion, we give our clients the scope to get more experience on their business space.</p>
<p>Check the track record of the outsourcing partner. Like, if you have a financial organization, then you might like to outsource the payroll. Check out how long the outsourcing partner has been with the payroll engaging system. Do make queries on the positive and negative feedback that other clients have to say on the chosen contractor.</p>
<h3>4) Assess Outsourcing Provider As A Regular Employee</h3>
<p>When you assess or evaluate an outsourcing provider, ask them questions just like you ask an organic employee. Choosing an outsourcing company is always subjective but that does not mean that you will stop yourself being objective.  Rather, ask for references and the performance of the service provider on their own accounts.</p>
<h3>5) Start Small</h3>
<p>Start small when you outsource your business to the leading BPO service providers. This will help you to pull back, when things do not run well. You will be saved from a lot of anxiety. You will also get an idea on how your provider performs before you can think of possible expansion.</p>
<p>Go ahead with the leading BPO companies like Fusion to engage yourself with the benefits of outsourcing and stay away from the anxiety.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the month of March, Senate members reviewed and confirmed that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_federal_budget" target="_blank">U.S. federal budget</a> deficit jumped in February from January. Higher taxes and improving economy are expected to hold back the annual deficit below $1 trillion for the first time since President Obama took office.</p>
<p>However, the graph was positive, but the major blow was given by <a href="http://paulryan.house.gov/" target="_blank">Rep. Paul Ryan</a>&#8216;s proposed budget. What does his budget propose?</p>
<ul>
<li>Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairperson, released his latest fiscal proposal on Tuesday, aims to reduce government spending outside of Social Security and interest on debt to its lowest levels in over six decades &#8211; <em>Reported by</em> <a href="http://news.investors.com/blogs-capital-hill/031313-647833-house-gop-budget-core-spending-lowest-since-1948.htm" target="_blank">Investor’s Business Daily</a>.<b><br />
</b></li>
<li>He cuts over $4.6 trillion. The blueprint aims to balance the budget in 10 years by slashing important amenities. If the proposed budget is approved, how will this budget influence the outsourcing and other major offshore industries? &#8211; <em>Reported by</em> <a href="http://news.investors.com/blogs-capital-hill/031313-647833-house-gop-budget-core-spending-lowest-since-1948.htm" target="_blank">Investor’s Business Daily</a>.</li>
<li>Budget year began on Oct. 1, with a deficit of $494 billion. That&#8217;s nearly $87 billion lower than the budget gap for the same period in 2011. Even with this improvement, the government would be required to borrow 24 cents of every dollar this year &#8211; <em>Reported by</em> <a href="http://business.time.com/2013/03/13/us-budget-deficit-jumps-in-february-by-204b/" target="_blank">Business.Time.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Questions that may rise globally in the minds of people are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is Ryan of the opinion to stop the excess expenditure through this proposed budget?</li>
<li>Is that the reason he is proposing a budget that goes against the poor Americans?</li>
<li>What will be the state of jobs in America? Since, Ryan’s budget proposal is going to kill millions of jobs.</li>
<li>In the midst of all this chaos, how latent topic of outsourcing will be benefited?</li>
</ul>
<p>We will look at the US budget and its impact in Indian outsourcing industry in 2013.</p>
<h3><i>US Budget Vs. Outsourcing in India</i></h3>
<p>Last year the political duel between Mitt Romney and Obama had a serious impact on the outsourcing business. Romney in favor of escalate the outsourcing business just slipped the political game, whereas Obama was interested to slash down the outsourcing level, won back his office. However, after Obama took the office and the recent escalation of the US economy is suddenly changing the notion of America towards outsourcing.</p>
<p>Indian outsourcing industry, which faced a stiff competition in the year 2012, gears up to make 2013 bigger and profitable. India is eagerly looking at the facts where a large amount of money will start flowing to the outsourcing industry in India.</p>
<p>Most of the outsourcing companies in India are on the verge of renewing their contracts that were linked ten years back. Economist estimate that the amount will be somewhere around $50 billion – more than half of the total Indian outsourcing industry. This claim, that 2013 will be a busy year for the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-india-is-taking-business-to-the-next-level.html">Indian offshore outsourcing providers</a> like <em>Fusion</em> and other leading brands.</p>
<p>The owners must grab the opportunity at any cost to revitalize their business. They must sharpen the strategic weapons to gain an edge over their competitors. Companies are leaving the techniques that have ruled the outsourcing industry for decades. Rather they are thinking to restructure the offshore outsourcing models. They are going on experimenting with new methods that are not only going to focus on the cost-reduction, but improve the quality, control and communication efficacy.</p>
<p>The same trend is likely to be seen in the small and medium sized business as they are going to unleash their spree of innovations to give more personalized and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/services.html">cost-effective offshore outsourcing solutions</a>. Building their own offshore contact centers is the most common strategy adopted by the big MNCs. This helps them to get skillful human resource, control over different aspects of business and cost-efficiency as compared to onsite development centers.</p>
<h3><i>How US Budget Is Changing Outsourcing Outlook In India?</i></h3>
<p>In spite of Ryan’s brutal stab, bringing back the offshore manufacturing this year will be the main aim for major brands. Just bringing back the jobs is not the aim and it is not going to work for a global economy, India is trying for something sustainable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Indian contact centers are equipping people with trends ahead of time and re-equipping them to work with new conditions effectively.</li>
<li>Traditional model can support the business with cost advantage but the major downside is its inefficiency. To repair and cope up with the standards of Indian outsourcing, they are going under a complete makeover.</li>
<li>A new generation offshore outsourcing companies in India are aiming to imbibe the factor ‘My Own’ flavor to their offshore structure. They have shifted their focus to the global staffing model instead of global contacting model. This will ensure 100% control in employee management, recruitment and project development.</li>
<li>Another major aspect that they contribute is the highest degree of transparency to build rapport between offshore vendors and clients. Costs associated with this model are different from the traditional models.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, in the coming days it is expected that the new model of outsourcing will play a pivotal role in India.</p>
<p>Working against the globalization and technology is futile if we have to keep at par with Ryan’s proposed budget. Therefore, it’s time to keep fingers crossed and hopes high for the Indian outsourcing industry.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Going by the statistics, among 25 job holders in America, one is within the contact center industry. &#8211; Isn’t it a little thought provoking?</p>
<p>What do you think is in store of the contact center future? What do you think will happen to the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/what-it-takes-to-become-a-next-gen-contact-centers.html">outsourcing industry in 2013</a>? What are the changes they are going to experience this year and in near future?</p>
<p>Well, <em>Fusion</em> is a leader in the contact center services shares their list of compelling statistics, which are going to shape the outlook of the outsourcing world in 2013 and coming years.</p>
<p>Check out the 13 compelling statistics to shape the future of outsourcing &#8211;</p>
<h3>Self-Service and Call Automation Process<b><br />
</b></h3>
<ol>
<li>Number of customers who prefer automated Self-Service has doubled to 55% in the last five years.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/importance-of-ivr-technology-in-call-centers.html">IVR system</a> accounts for one-third of the total call experience. However, presently only 7% of them offer a better experience than live agents.</li>
</ol>
<p>Self-service keeps on growing every minute and changes the customer preference. Customers expect immediate service and satisfaction. Customers in the recent years expect instant gratification when it comes to customer service. They are savvy with the tools and provide immediate communication. They are not going to stay on hold. In 2013, you have to live up to their expectations. Employ artificial intelligence to make the self-service smarter and faster!</p>
<h3>Customer Service</h3>
<ol start="3">
<li>In this negative economy, customer experience is the highest priority and among customers, 60% is ready to pay for a better experience.</li>
<li>86% of the customers quit the business for a bad customer experience, 89% shifts to the competitor for a poor customer service, 59% tries a new brand for a better experience.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/customer-experience.jpg" alt="Customer Experience Impact" width="600" height="328" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4800" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/customer-experience.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/customer-experience-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Three things that you need to improve the outsourcing outlook in 2013 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross selling and up selling – (by 32 %)</li>
<li>Customer satisfaction – (by 33 %)</li>
<li>Customer retention – (by 42 %)</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot ignore the customer service and its aspects and if you neglect the quality of your customer service, then you will lose all the key consumers to your competitors. We at <em>Fusion</em> know our key customers who are ready to pay for better service and superior experience. So, we serve them in the best possible way.</p>
<h3>Quality and Performance Assessment<b><br />
</b></h3>
<ol start="5">
<li>According to the Forester Research, 31% of the organizations closely monitor the interactions with their target customers.</li>
<li>According to the A <a href="http://www.saddletreeresearch.com" target="_blank">Saddletree Research</a> Paper, done in 2012, 92% of the contact center leaders see high value in the sharing metrics that too in real time with the front-line agents.</li>
<li>Only 31% of the organization, according to the <a href="http://www.forrester.com/The+Customer+Experience+Index+2010/fulltext/-/E-RES55833?docid=55833" target="_blank">Forester Research</a> gets rewarded for their services across different companies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Top 5 five metrics shared in real time, can fetch high values include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Calls in Queue</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Customer Satisfaction</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>First Contact Resolution</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Service Level</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Schedule Adherence</i></b> (Not given in order)</li>
</ul>
<p>These stats show<b> </b>how companies need to pay more attention to agent quality and performance management in 2013, to maximize the potential of their employee. During this year, we need to employ the agents with real-time performance metrics and information. Most of the contact centers in 2012 failed to maintain their quality due to less customer insight from multiple siloed systems and applications to share the data.</p>
<p>The deployment of real time performance management software in 2013 will let you consolidate metrics from multiple contact centers and business applications. Another solution is the workflow automation and embedded analytics with QA solutions to help the customers and increase the revenues.</p>
<h3>Multi-Channel Networks</h3>
<ol start="8">
<li>Other than the phone, we have other service like to chat, use web self-service that accounts around 30% of the customer service engagements. 25% of the customers seek the help of one or two channels and 52% uses three to four channels.</li>
<li>In the United States 21% of the online shoppers like to have a live chat and 23% uses their phone and most of the crowd prefers to engage though emails, say around 54%. (This statistic is affirmed by the Bold Chat Group)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2013, the contact centers are going to use many channels to reach out to their customers. As they have to give 24-hour support, so they may consider any channel of communication. Example, number of business and contact centers are implementing live chat to meet the rising demand.</p>
<h3>Social Media</h3>
<ol start="10">
<li>50% of Facebook users and 80% of Twitter users expect to get a response to their customer service inquiry within a day. Failure to respond to the social media channels can increase the churn rate by 15%. <b></b></li>
<li>Customers since 2009 have been interacting over the social media channels. They are able to receive follow-up from the company, with 20% better and smarter contact center experience.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/social-customer-services-personalize-customer-support.html">Social media boost customer satisfaction</a>. Therefore, the contact centers have to be fast and must interact with the customer immediately or share their positive experience just with a click of a button.</p>
<h3>Cloud</h3>
<ol start="12">
<li>According to the <a href="http://www.dmgconsult.com/services/hostedCC/abstract.asp" target="_blank">DMG Consulting</a>, by 2015, 18% of the contact centers are going to <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/call-center-outsourcing-become-more-efficient.html">deliver cloud based contact center solutions</a>.</li>
<li>Around 57% of the users feel that the use of cloud computing has increased their security, if we compare the traditional methods for computing against the data backup.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of the contact centers by 2013 are going to change their call center environment with the use of cloud and finally contribute to the escalation of various processes.</p>
<p>These statistics are not only going to prove the changing outlook of outsourcing in 2013, but also show what transformations a contact center must achieve to make themselves proactive. Call center armed with right solutions is going to reap bigger productivity in future.</p>
