								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Owning a small business is tough. You have to juggle a lot of tasks, including answering calls. That’s one task that can claim a huge chunk of your precious time.</p>
<p>Don’t get us wrong.  We know that interacting with the buyer is one of the most crucial things to build your business. But spending too much time on answering the customer queries can shift your focus from the other important tasks, such as &#8211; marketing, and stocktaking.</p>
<p>The point is, it simply isn&#8217;t logical to spend much time on the phone when you have a business to manage.  Then again, if your customers and prospects reach your voicemail upon calling, they will be frustrated. That would lose you a lot of business. What to do?</p>
<p>Sure, you can hire a full-time employee to attend the calls. But that might just be a waste of money. What you can do instead, is hire an answering service. A virtual receptionist will ensure that your customers are received warmly every single time.  The service will maintain the highest level of efficiency, professionalism, and a personal touch.</p>
<p>A good live answering service helps a business solve a number of challenges, including:</p>
<h3>Providing customer support 24/7/365</h3>
<p>No matter how dedicated you are to your customers and business, you cannot always be there to answer the phone. Installing an answering machine or voicemail isn’t much help either; since most people are refusing to leave a message at the beep. On the other hand, an answering service available 24/7/365 at your aid means that there is a friendly agent to greet your callers, make them feel more comfortable to leave messages or ask questions, and get them what they need, pronto.</p>
<h3>Handling common issues without getting involved</h3>
<p>You can save your precious time and money by providing your answering service with specific instructions to handle common calls. Thus, when a caller inquires about your business hours or returns policy, the agent can provide them with that information right away.  There is no need for you to get involved.  They can even offer scripted guidance to aid a customer.  For example – while setting up an appointment with the doctor, an answering service hired by a doctor can remind people to bring previous prescriptions and other documents to the appointment.</p>
<h3>Re-routing calls to a designated emergency number</h3>
<p>You get your fair share of after-hour phone calls in the emergency number, and we know how much it stresses you out to handle them.  On the other hand, if you entrust the task to an answering service, they will make sure that each of the calls gets answered, each message gets noted, and you are not contacted unless there’s a real emergency. This way, your off time remains yours.</p>
<h3>Getting an organized list for call-backs</h3>
<p>Why waste time making a list of callers from your voicemail, when you can route calls through your answering service partner? You will receive a tidy log of callers, complete with their needs and phone numbers. You can quickly check the list off as you contact the callers. Being organized gives you the chance to become incredibly responsive to customer needs. You’ll return calls more quickly, and not forget a single message.</p>
<p>There are many challenges that hiring an answering service can solve quickly and affordably, irrespective of the size or type of your business. At Fusion, we are trained to keep your clients’ information confidential and secure while providing your business with a warm, friendly voice.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Entrepreneurs look down at outsourcing as a strategy for the big businesses. Now, beside the <i>Big Daddies</i> of business, technology is developing accessible tools for the small business owners. For smaller firms, outsourcing is creating bigger impact and bigger profits just like the big businesses.</p>
<p>More number of small businesses are interested in outsourcing their task. For them the outsourcing partners have moved a step ahead to compel the professionals to work from anywhere. These have reduced the overhead costs, payroll taxes, health insurance, workers compensations, space constrictions that the small business owners might need to provide, if they maintained an in-house call center.</p>
<p>There are a number of successful corporations, which are using the outsourcing services for years. <i>Why they outsource?</i> These successful business organizations have witnessed that certain aspect of the business, like outsourcing is no longer cost inefficient. Maintaining an in-house contact center team is not going to give them a competitive advantage that an outsourcing partner can give.</p>
<p>Just like other leading outsourcing companies, Fusion is actively rendering call center services to a number of small businesses, and allowing them to touch the biggest profit margins.</p>
<p>The organizations are happy to refocus their resources to the contact centers. Organizations also think that those resources are now efficiently used and perform the tasks profitably just like their in-house members. Now with profitability they have sledged the overhead expenses. So now, profit comes with savings.</p>
<h3>Macro Approach towards Business with the Help of Outsourcing</h3>
<p>Well, outsourcing allows a macro view of the business and generates profit so that you are able to employ resources in a way that generates profit.</p>
<p>Take for example, Ford purchases $300 million in supplies per month from approximately 200 vendors. Among them, they use 150,000 parts every month from the outside vendors.</p>
<p>Why do you think that it has happened? &#8211;  Is it because Ford does not have the ability to manufacture the automobile parts? Actually, they own some of the largest vendors. Ford could buy any vendor at any time. However, they restrain from doing so, because it would be inefficient to own all the aspects of the supply chain. Ford thinks not to waste the limited resources stamping out the parts, which they cannot manufacture with fullest efficiency.</p>
<h3>How Will You Relate This Example To Small Business And Outsourcing?</h3>
<p>It’s simple. Outsourcing is the perfect gel for the small business owners beside the business giants. When you think to leverage your business to outsourcing services, it means you will get ample of time to focus on the core business aspects.  All these aspects indicate, solutions and perfection just like the bigger businesses.</p>
<p>With the help of contact center representative, the small business owner can &#8211; save their time, get better prospects, retain the customer service to a higher level and meet out all the essential aspects of a big organization.</p>
<p>Whether the business is large or small, the core business function is closing business. Prospecting is just the input to synchronize the signing deals.  At every time, business uses the inputs to get the better outputs. More efficiently, the small business uses the resource, the more profitable it becomes.</p>
<p>So it is a question to all small business owners – <i>Will You Like to Build and Sell a Lexus or You Will Like to Concentrate on Your Efforts to Design the Tail Light?</i> If you are ready to take the business to the next level, then prepare to take the tail light into the assembly line.</p>
