								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Social customer service is an important tool to build
customer experience, drive loyalty, enhance brand reputation and lower
operational expenses by reducing the volume of customer service calls.&nbsp; However, in order to successfully cater to
your customers through social customer service you need to offer quick response
and resolution. </p>



<p>Exposed to the gold standard of customer service, consumers
today want answers to their queries and resolutions to their issues and they
want it right now. They do not have time to wait for a day to get a response of
an email or to wait in an IVR queue to talk to another human. In such
situations social customer support can come to the company’s rescue.&nbsp; When done rightly the personal, knowledgeable
and helpful nature of social customer service can not only resolve customer
issues pronto but can also drive better customer experience and boost brand
reputation.</p>



<p>But the question is, how can a brand with limited resources,
small teams, and isolated departments (CRM, helpdesk, customer support, and
social) deliver faster and more effective customer care interactions via social
media? Here are a few tips:</p>



<h3>1. Show the human face of your company</h3>



<p>Your customers prefer interacting with other people, not
automated systems. Social customer care agents can quickly connect with
consumers on a personal level by showing empathy for the consumer and their
issues.&nbsp; And thus, they create the opportunity
to diagnose an issue further, leading to quicker resolution. This also improves
your brand perception.</p>



<h3>2. Acknowledge pronto</h3>



<p>It is possible that a social customer care agent may not
have all the answers or that resolving the issue requires the customer to be
redirected to another department or channel (for due to personally identifiable
information requirements or other sensitive information), the agent must let
the customer know that they are on the care and the brand cares for its
customers. Customers today are willing to wait a little if the company
acknowledges their requests or issues. </p>



<p>In case an issue cannot be resolved right away, the agents
should provide the customer with a timeframe and stick to it. A little delay
here and there is okay but do not go a whole day past the deadline to provide a
response.&nbsp; This way your company can lose
their precious goodwill.</p>



<h3>3. Don’t compel customer to change the channel unless absolutely necessary</h3>



<p>Customers today prefer to get a response to their issue in
the same channel through which they interacted with the company regarding the
issue.&nbsp; While there are times when
conversations need to be taken offline, businesses should attempt to respond to
issues publicly through the same channel where the inquiry is made. Pushing your
customers from one channel to another is never a good idea. This leads to
confusion and frustration and increases the resolution time significantly.</p>



<h3>4. Clearly mention operating hours</h3>



<p>If you can’t provide 24-hour social care support, have the information clearly listed across all channels. Better still <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com">hire a BPO for managing your social customer care</a> during the non-operational hours.  If that is not an option for you, make sure to list other communication channels of your brand, as well as links to other useful information, FAQs, easy-fix videos, and much more.</p>



<h3>5. Get the right for the right job</h3>



<p>Your social care team should be armed with the right tools
and training, and tested against any type of scenarios. You can either integrate
social experts into the traditional call center or transition and train members
of the call center for social response. Availing the social customer care
services from a reputed BPO can also be a solution. However, be sure to have a
tight integration between your inhouse customer service team and the outsourced
ones. This will help you identify mass issues quickly by addressing your
customers through proactive posts and messages across all communication
channels. It will also reduce the response time and volume of inquiries through
social and traditional channels. </p>



<h3>6. FAQs and pre-approved information</h3>



<p>If you analyze the queries carefully, you can always find a
list of questions that are repeated time and again across all channels. You can
easily develop a list of these FAQs with their responses, get it approved and
keep it stored in a content library for quick distribution. This will help you
in reducing the social care response time and costs and improve the efficacy of
your social care team.</p>



<h3>7. Know the Customers</h3>



<p>Knowing your customers and understanding their value to your
company can help you prioritize responses and decide the way some individual
cases are handled. A customer with a wide social footprint, or a brand advocate
with deep knowledge about your product should get a priority treatment.&nbsp; Therefore, social care agents must look for
social profile information of a customer before responding. </p>



<p>However, you must also know the time when most of your
customers are active on social media and manage your workforces accordingly to
provide quick and efficient resolutions to all your customers. The response
provided to all customers should be prompts, personalized with thoughtful in
order to increase their satisfaction level.</p>



<h3>8. Get Right Tools</h3>



<p>You need to have the right tools and technology in place for more effective and efficient care. With the use of monitoring, categorization, filtering and automated routing, together with approval workflows and measurement as well as reporting capabilities social care efforts can be speeded up and improved.</p>



<p>Like all customer service channels social customer service too needs to be managed quickly and thoughtfully. If you do not speed up the response times, or leave questions unanswered your customers will feel devalued and frustrated and will vent their annoyance in public. Therefore, bad social customer service is worse than having no social customer service at all. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last year we have seen social media emerge as one of the most prominent customer service channels. Consumers today are more prone to use social media to communicate their questions, compliments, or complaints with businesses. According to <a href="https://blog.sprinklr.com/5-stats-social-media-customer-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Sprinklr</a>, 80% of consumers engage with brands online, and 54% of customers prefer social messaging channels for care instead of phone or email. And that means customers today expect companies to have a strong social customer service channel round the clock.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-things-customer-service-should-monitor-on-social-media.html">Social customer service</a> is rapidly maturing as a customer service channel.  Here are a few customer service trends that have dominated social media in 2018 and will continue to do so in 2019.</p>



<h3>1. More people using direct messages</h3>



<p>More consumers are connecting with companies through direct
messaging (Twitter) and Facebook messenger rather than tagging them on social
media posts. This way, consumers can upload photos, videos, and sensitive
personal information while communicating with a business without broadcasting
it to the world. It has also become easier to control the damage.</p>



<h3>2. Customer care bots will continue to rise</h3>



<p>Customer care bots, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-chatbots-reshaping-customer-service-kishore-saraogi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="chatbots (opens in a new tab)">chatbots</a>, allow companies to offer round the clock, automated replies that can instantly help customers fix a technical issue or even order their lunch. While chatbots can be the quick-and-easy and cost-effective solutions to common queries, it can deliver e less-than-satisfactory experience when implemented without a strategy. </p>



<p>The truth is, chatbots are still evolving and has a long way to go before it can provide a communication similar to real- life interaction. Yet, experts have high hopes for this customer care According to a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/09/chatbots-expected-to-cut-business-costs-by-8-billion-by-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="report (opens in a new tab)">report</a>, chatbots could cut business costs by $8 billion by 2022.</p>



<h3>3. Social care strategies getting more personal</h3>



<p>Stepping in 2019, we are seeing that more brands are
adopting their social media customer care strategies, and are gravitating
towards personalization. Companies today are focusing more and more towards
personalization, active conversation through messaging in a casual tone using
emojis. Once perfected, social care strategies will start providing
personalized care for a fraction of the cost of traditional customer care channels.</p>



<h3>4. Customer care agents are using social data</h3>



<p>Marketing and PR departments have long used social data to
influence decisions, but now customer care teams are using it to shape
interactions. Today it is easy to use technology to track both positive and negative
mentions and reply quickly.&nbsp; This way a
company can show how much they care. </p>



<p>Social data is also helping social customer care agents to
know more about the customer and shape their interactions according to it. For
example &#8211; if your customers are talking about how you can use less plastic in
packaging your product, you can use this opportunity to tell them about your
eco-friendly efforts and what steps are being used to reduce plastic usage. You
can also use the same data to change your social advertisement patterns.</p>



<h3>5. Customer care is the new marketing</h3>



<p>With consumer interactions more public, customer care is
becoming the new marketing. While one cannot replace the other — they can work
side by side to bring their customers the best of both worlds.&nbsp; When a company does an excellent job in
taking care of public and personal messages on social media, words spread
faster, resulting in more business. 

These are some of the most popular social media
customer service trends that are going to take the customer service space by
storm in 2019.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deciphering customer insights on social media can be tough. The volume and frequency of social information can be overwhelming and hard to keep a tab on, and that makes monitoring and responding to customers very difficult at times.</p>
<p>However, one must remember, social customer service is very important.</p>
<p>As per <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/12/12/social-media-we-complain-879-million-timesyear-and-facebook-is-our-top-target/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VB Insights</a>, there were over 879 million customer complaints on social media in 2014.  It proves that customers are vocal on social channels and companies need to listen, analyze and act upon those complaints. A company should employ its social customer service team track the right things to keep up with social traffic and respond accordingly. Here&#8217;s what the team should be tracking:</p>
<p><strong>1. Keywords</strong></p>
<p>Tracking and monitoring keywords allow a social customer service team to spot trends and respond to feedback pronto. When the same words or phrases keep popping up, there must be a reason.</p>
<p>Whether customers are experiencing issues with a certain product or they are very pleased with a new feature, it is important to be in the know of common threads so you can address the feedback quickly and make any required changes at the business level.</p>
<p><strong>2. Tone</strong></p>
<p>It is important to take note of the tone a customer uses in their feedback. This can be mainly challenging when it comes to social media. Finding the ironic or sarcastic tone so frequently found on social channels can be hard when people are sorting through feedbacks quickly. But one has to understand tone to decipher each piece of feedback.</p>
<p>This can be done using sophisticated text analytics technologies that can automate the process of deciphering tone.</p>
<p><strong>3. Emotion</strong></p>
<p>Social customer service teams also need to look out for emotion. Social channels such as Twitter and Facebook are emotionally stimulating platforms where people convey personal opinions, share stories, and engage with others.</p>
<p>It is one of the few places where companies can access spontaneous and totally candid feedback from customers, which helps companies better understand wants and requirements of their customers. It will also create a better customer experience and build a deeper bond between the company and its customers.</p>
<p><strong>4. Frequency</strong></p>
<p>A social customer service team should also track how many customer service issues are coming in through social channels each month, their level of severity, type of issues, and the follow-up action taken.</p>
<p>It is also important to track positive mentions and feedback so the company can know what&#8217;s working well and what customers are most excited about. It can also help companies keep a track of the trends and change their social customer service strategies accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>5. Response Time</strong></p>
<p>Finally, it is important to track how long it takes a social customer service team to respond to feedback and the average time taken to resolve an issue. There is a lot of information that the team is tracking on a daily basis and social feedback is flooding in all the time. But addressing and resolving that feedback in a timely matter is the most important step. It keeps customers loyal and cuts down on attrition.</p>
<p>So a company should make sure that their social customer service team monitoring response time and constantly working to address feedback as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Creating a social customer strategy is always a good idea in the digital world of today. Most experts would say that it is even critical to the survival and prosperity of the brand. According to recent research, 40% of <a href="http://www.five9.com/social-customer-care-infographic">consumers use social media for customer support</a> and it results in higher customer satisfaction and loyalty, according to 61% and 58% survey respondents.</p>
<p>However, the shocking part is that many organizations are not doing enough to keep up with consumers on social media to engage them.  The research <a href="http://www.five9.com/social-customer-care-infographic">study</a>, conducted by the International Customer Management Institute (ICMI) and Five9, shows over 68% of businesses recognize social media as a necessary service channel, however, 60% do not support social customer care formally because they do not feel that they have the right tools or resources.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6277" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/social-customer-care-infographic.jpg" alt="SOCIAL CUSTOMER CARE STUDY BY INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE (ICMI)" width="600" height="913" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/social-customer-care-infographic.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/social-customer-care-infographic-197x300.jpg 197w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/social-customer-care-infographic-300x457.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>It is high time companies take proactive steps to provide social customer support or risk losing customers to the competition. How to develop an effective social customer support program? Here are the top three best practices a company can easily develop:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>Personalized Customer Service</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is common for customers to use multiple communication channels to resolve a single issue. Therefore, companies need to be sure they are optimizing customer engagement at every stage of the customer journey. Doing so involves creating a complete customer profile, identifying their pain points, values, behaviors, channel preferences, etc.; As well as analyzing every interaction agents have with customers across multiple channels.</p>
<p>Doing so will ensure that your customers get a prompt answer to their queries via their channel of choice. It will give the impression of personalized attention to each customer and increase customer satisfaction.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2>Dedicated Resources to Social Customer Service</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the fast-paced digital landscape of recent times, customers expect real-time support from companies. However, many organizations are increasingly falling short of customer expectations. According to a study, 80% of social media responses took an <a href="http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/why-brands-dont-respond-on-social-media/200090">average of 12 hours</a>, compared to an <a href="http://www.dialogtech.com/blog/call-management/the-56-second-hold-time-bogey-average-customer-wait-times-an-ifbyphone-benchmarking-analysis-part-2">average wait time of just 56 seconds</a> over the phone.</p>
<p>To cater to the needs of the connected customer, organizations should dedicate specific resources to each channel, and social media is no exception. They need to allocate trained customer service agents to handle requests specific to each channel. This process will eventually provide a better service experience for customers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2>Investing in Agent Performance Improvements</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To continually grow and manage a team of agents, managers and supervisors should offer ongoing training opportunities, which can make agents feel satisfied with their jobs and keep them committed to their customers.  Now, the question remains: How can an organization achieve this?</p>
<p>There are a variety of <a href="http://www.sociableblog.com/2016/09/19/15-phrases-never-use-when-responding-to-customers-on-socialmedia/">ways to improve</a> agent performance on a continuous basis, such as speech analytics solutions, workforce optimization software, agent scorecards, and much more. The idea is to approach customer service improvements across each channel, not just on social media, to drive customer engagement optimization all over the customer lifecycle.</p>
<p>Social listening, as well as sentiment analysis, are other ways to evaluate agent and overall company performance. This is done by analyzing positive and negative mentions across social networks. A brand can address a negative mention proactively and turn the public complaint into a sharable solution. It also makes an irate customer see that the brand really cares about their problems and thinks about them.</p>
<p>Social media is a communications channel that is only increasing in importance with customers and becoming an integral part of customer support programs. The sooner companies realize this, the better it is for them.</p>
<p>To create an effective social customer support process, companies need to personalize customer service, dedicate resources to social media and invest in agent performance improvements. All these will ensure a positive customer experience.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Customers have always been the king but being a customer in the present era has its own benefits. Sure, one can argue that since the beginning of business, customers were given much importance and as a result, customer service was always an important aspect of business.</p>
<p>But if you look closely, you will realize that the percentage of business owners taking interest in providing their customers with quality customer service is far greater than it previously was. in fact, during the last decade,  the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html" target="_blank">importance of customer service  has increased</a> exponentially.  Which makes us wonder, what can we expect Customer Service to become in the coming decade?</p>
<p>To find out, let’s take a quick look at the changes in the awareness level, both among the customers and the business owners alike.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to Accenture global customer satisfaction report 2008, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130604134550-284615-15-statistics-that-should-change-the-business-world-but-haven-t" target="_blank">price is not the main reason for customer churn</a>; it is actually due to the overall poor quality of customer service.</li>
<li>According to the White House Office of Consumer Affairs as reported by <a href="http://returnonbehavior.com/2010/10/50-facts-about-customer-experience-for-2011/" target="_blank">Return on Behavior</a> magazine Loyal customers are worth up to ten times as much as their first purchase.</li>
<li>70% of buying experiences are based on how the customer feels they are being treated – <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/the_moment_of_truth_in_customer_service" target="_blank">McKinsey</a>.</li>
<li>55% of customers would <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/10/customer-service-stats-55-of-consumers-would-pay-more-for-a-better-service-experience.html" target="_blank">pay extra to guarantee a better service</a> – Defaqto research.</li>
</ul>
<p>if you combine just these four stats together, you  will have no doubt that customer loyalty has  become one of the most sought after realities, to business owners, and, Customer Service is the only thing that can transform a onetime customer into a loyal one.</p>
<p>As customers are becoming more aware of their importance, more and more businesses are coming onboard giving customer service a shout out.</p>
<p>In our industry, some of the most recognizable customer service trends of the present decade include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-channel customer Service</li>
<li>Omni-channel customer service</li>
<li>IVR-Supported customer service</li>
<li>Social customer service</li>
<li>Reduction of wait time and inclusion of call back request</li>
<li>Video call customer support</li>
<li>One tap customer support</li>
</ul>
<p>With more and more businesses nodding in favor of better and more innovative customer support, we can all expect the customer service scene to change even more in the next decade.  So, let’s take a quick look at the possible trends that will still be there in the next decade:</p>
<h2><strong>Multi-Channel Customer Service will be a norm</strong></h2>
<p>With more and more businesses providing multi-channel customer service, it will cease to be deemed as a perk. By the year 2020, the multichannel customer service will become the new norm.</p>
<p><strong>The magnitude of multi-channel will also increase</strong></p>
<p>By 2020, a variety of new social media communication channels will also be included in the bevy of customer service channels. And businesses will surely connect with their customers using the most popular of these channels.</p>
<p><strong>Integration of customer data for all channels will be a reality</strong></p>
<p>In  the near  future,  we will be able to see a complete  integration  of customer data to ensure  that a customer  does not  have to repeat themselves in case they contact a business  more than once, using  different  channels.  If the customer data is stored systematically, an agent can easily take a quick look at it and understand the problem customer is facing, he or she can also suggest the customer some product, based on the purchasing preference data and thus earn a business some additional revenue. The integrated customer data will also help businesses provide a personalized customer service.</p>
<p><strong>More businesses will opt for Customer Service outsourcing</strong></p>
<p>According to a new report from the Economist Intelligence Unit titled <a href="http://www.economistinsights.com/search/node/service%202020" target="_blank">Services 2020: Megatrends</a>, 87% of participants take care of their service offering in-house.  However, in the coming decade, the demand for service provider specialists is likely to increase.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is one of the most popular channels for <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html" target="_blank">customer service</a>. It is also deemed to be the most difficult channel for customer service as well.</p>
<p>As social media brings a business in front of millions of customers and prospects, one wrong move from the company representative can cost the business a large number of customers and an even larger number of prospects. Surely we don’t want that, do we?</p>
<p>As social media enthusiasts from across the world are preparing to celebrate Social Media Day by the end of June, Fusion looks forward by sharing few useful few tips regarding social media customer service from its experiences as a customer service BPO.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Choose the right channels</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Facebook and Twitter are not the only two social media platforms available. There’s also Pinterest, Instagram, Youtube, Google+ and a host of <a href="http://www.sociableblog.com/category/social-media/" target="_blank">other platforms</a>. While Twitter, Facebook and Google+ give you the opportunity to express your thoughts via text, most other social media platforms do not have the facility.</p>
<p>For example, Instagram and Pinterest are image dominated while YouTube offers a platform to say it with videos. There are so many options. Therefore, take some time to decide your social media plan (text, video or image) and choose accordingly.</p>
<p>Also, do some research on where your customers are and opt for their preferred social media channel?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Define your company&#8217;s rules of engagement</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A business should always have a social media strategy, doing things haphazardly will make it worse. A business has to set up an alert to know every time someone mentions their brand online. This will keep you in the know about what is being said about your brand on social media.</p>
<p>Also checking those replies once in a day is not enough. You need to keep an eye on social media as often as possible. It should be like real time monitoring activity as the world is watching your brand name and protecting your brand name is very important.</p>
<p>Customer service over social media should be no different than that over the phone. Quick and real time response. And, for this reason, a business should entrust the call center with social media customer service.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Listen to customers first</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Millions of messages, images and videos are shared on the big social media platforms. So how will you know whether someone is talking about you? Setting an alert is a good option.</p>
<p>However, you may also opt for analytics, or make use of Facebook and Twitter’s search functionality complete with hashtags and @ mentions.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Respond promptly</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Responding within an hour of getting the message is acceptable, but if you reply after one whole day, you have made your customers very unhappy. And an unhappy customer may channel their righteous anger on different social media posts and cost you a few customers and prospects.</p>
<p>Even if a simple response like:– “<em>sorry for the inconvenience caused, our experts are looking into the matter. You will hear from us soon.</em>” Can calm an irate customer</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Don&#8217;t forget chivalry</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of dreading customer complaints, companies can turn them into opportunities to show their customer service values. By acknowledging and apologizing for mistakes, thanking the customer for the opportunity, companies can turn uncomfortable, potentially negative situations into opportunities to show their followers that they truly care.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong>Personalizing messages </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Automated and generic responses are easily spotted and can have a worse effect than not offering a response at all. On the other hand, personalized, unique interactions with customers on social media create stronger consumer/brand relationships.</p>
<p>A positive, friendly attitude with a little empathy, professionalism and courtesy on the part of the agent can do wonders.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h3><strong>Know your customers</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When possible, companies can link their CRM systems to their social media engagement platforms and identify customers on social media. They can then gauge the customers’ level of involvement, social influence, revenue potential, and overall value as a customer.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h3><strong>Make the post mobile friendly</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Pew Research, over <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-networking-fact-sheet/" target="_blank">40%</a> of all mobile users tend to access their social media accounts from their mobile, make sure to check whether the links that you have provided for their assistance are mobile friendly or not. They will appreciate your thoughtfulness.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<h3><strong>Post, don&#8217;t just reply</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Just posting replies for your fans is not enough. A business needs to be present on social media channels. Therefore, you should not only answer your customers’ queries but also involuntarily offer useful tips, share customer’s story and other materials that might help the customer.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<h3><strong>Make performance a priority</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not make fake promises on social media. Always deliver what you have promised promptly. Making performance a priority will give your business a reputation and help you gain the trust of your customers.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>
<h3><strong>Research their insight</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When your customers are posting queries, complaints or even feedback on social media, they are offering you valuable insights. These insights can act as the perfect research tool for you. Make productive changes in your end product/service based on the insight.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>
<h3><strong>Take the conversation offline</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If all fails, try to take the conversation offline. Asking for customer’s contact details and then calling him up is always helpful. It will take the conversation away from the public eye and pave the way for a personalized solution.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it will also make sure that if things go ugly the general social media user will not have to deal with the angry rant.</p>
<p>If you take care of these things, you are sure to deliver high-quality social media customer service to your customers.</p>
