								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hispanic community is one of the major ethnic groups in the United States. The Hispanic consumers account for over 15% of the total adult population in the US. In fact, Hispanic Millennials are far more active consumers than their older generations. They are  <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/235057/hispanic-millennials-not-what-you-think.html">17% of the total millennial crowd</a>. Just like any other Millennials these Hispanic Millennials too are the right audience for mobile engagement and mobile advertising.</p>
<p>Studies also show that while the rate of cell phone ownership of a Hispanic and a non-Hispanic are likely to be the same, the Hispanics are far more likely to have a smartphone as their primary device to connect to the internet than a non-Hispanic one. As a result, the opportunity for customer engagement via mobile is far greater in the case of a Hispanic consumer than a non-Hispanic one.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.experian.com/blogs/marketing-forward/2014/05/19/hispanics-are-mobile-dominant-are-your-campaigns/">Experian Marketing Services</a>, 63% of Hispanic adults own a smartphone as compared to 60% of non-Hispanics. Earlier in 2012, the numbers were 52% and 51% respectively. Experian Marketing Services also reveal that 45% of Hispanic smartphone owners are mobile-dominant in the case of internet usage While only 38% of non-Hispanics. So, as a matter of fact, Hispanics smartphone owners are 17% more likely than non-Hispanics to access the Internet through their phone than through a computer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6200" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hispanics-are-mobile-dominant.png" alt="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/how-to-direct-customers-to-the-right-service-channel.html" width="614" height="459" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hispanics-are-mobile-dominant.png 614w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hispanics-are-mobile-dominant-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></p>
<p>The above statistics clearly show that in <a href="https://medium.com/@arifulanam/3-strategies-that-bring-brands-closer-to-latino-audience-848da0a3fab6" target="_blank">order to grab the Hispanic audience attention</a>, one needs to opt for mobile-friendly marketing and customer service. In other words, a mobile-first approach will be the most useful tool for businesses trying to woo the Hispanic customer. If a business can design their campaigns, emails, websites and ecommerce initiatives to effectively engage a customer on a mobile device, they are far more likely to win over their Hispanic audience.</p>
<p>According to Experian, 37% of Hispanic adults admit using cell phones while watching television; whereas only 29% non-Hispanics admit to doing so. The study also reveals that, 50% of Hispanic smartphone owners use their phone while watching TV compared with just 42% people of other ethnicities. In the usage or smartphone during TV time, Hispanic Millennials standing at 61% beat Millennials of other ethnicities by 3%.</p>
<p>So, it won’t be an exaggeration to say that traditional advertising mediums like TV will not be an effective choice in launching marketing campaigns targeting Hispanic audience. If a business wants to win them over using minimum effort, knowing what specific <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/120400990015825965/">mobile activities Hispanics are engaging</a> can aid the marketers decide on the best mobile engagement strategy that includes telemarketing, email marketing, social media marketing and engagement through chat.</p>
<p>Besides, businesses can also take a mobile first approach in case of customer service. It will aid them to reach their customers via their preferred medium of communication – emails, chat, call, social media and a lot more. The <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/how-to-direct-customers-to-the-right-service-channel.html" target="_blank">multichannel customer service approach</a> will surely work for the Hispanic consumers. A multilingual or Spanish multichannel call center can aid the businesses in their pursuit.</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever you target the Hispanic market that is known for their $1 trillion in purchasing power, think mobile-first. Whether it is a marketing campaign or customer service, a mobile first approach with both English and <a href="http://www.ocurrance.com/spanish-call-center.html?utm_source=Fusion&amp;utm_medium=fusionblog&amp;utm_campaign=FusionBlog" target="_blank">Spanish language customer support</a> will help you become successful in the Hispanic market</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are those days when businesses in the United States used to pay no attention to the Latino community. Nowadays, they are the apple of every businessman’s eyes. And why not? This third largest ethnic group in the United States boasts a <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/engaging-the-evolving-hispanic-consumers.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$1.4 trillion</a> purchasing capacity. Now, that is a market that every business wants to enter.</p>
<p>Now, before concentrating on how businesses can win the Latino people over with, take a quick look at why businesses have ignored them so far? A few years back, it was thought that the Latino people are too loyal to change their brands and that they are not interested in luxury products.</p>
<p>However, the recent years have proven things otherwise. Today, thanks to the rise in purchasing capacity, the Hispanics are willing to experiment with brands and luxury products. Hence, more and more businesses are getting increasingly interested in conquering this marketplace.</p>
<p>However, entering this market has not been as easy for the businesses as entering other markets. There are some tight spots that businesses have to come out of first. And in order to do so, they will have to know what those tight spots are.</p>
<p>Dealing with Latino community, businesses often face language issues. As most Latino people use Spanish as their first language, businesses have to do their promotions all over again in order to approach the Hispanic audience.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Latino people have a very different culture than the US. So, in order to make them buy a product, businesses have to adapt to their culture and convince them that the products or services they are offering are in perfect harmony with the Latino culture.</p>
<p>While both of these were very tough challenges for the businesses, they came up with some exciting solutions for these challenges.</p>
<h3><strong>Challenge 1: Language Issues</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>  As most people of the Latino community chiefly speaks Spanish, the promotions and customer communications has to be in Spanish.</p>
<p>For promotions, everything from print, radio and TV ads to infomercials has to be in Spanish, so that it reaches the highest number of audience.</p>
<p>As for customer service, Spanish should be the prime mode of conversation. For this, businesses can have an in-house Spanish contact center or <a href="http://www.ocurrance.com/spanish-call-center.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hire a Spanish call center service from Central America</a>. While in-house contact center can be a pricey option for businesses, hiring one is an economic solution. It also allows businesses to render world class service to their customers.</p>
<h3><strong>Challenge 2: Cultural Issues</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> In order to deal with the cultural issues, companies have to introduce Latino culture in their marketing and promotional activities. For example – they can offer a discount during Latino festivals; <a href="http://www.ordersatellitenow.com/blog/dishlatino-launches-its-first-ever-cross-border-promotion.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hire a Latino celebrity</a> for the promotional activities for the businesses. It will help them come closer to the Latino community, which eventually adds to their benefit.</p>
<p>Apart from these two major issues, there are some other issues a business has to keep in mind while entering the Latino marketplace.</p>
<p>Just changing promotional and customer relation strategies are not going to be enough to stay in the Latino marketplace. For that, businesses need to make some changes in their management structures as well. They must have a member of Latino community in the top management in order to oversee the best interests of the Latino consumers.</p>
<p>Having a Latino brand ambassador can also be a good strategy on behalf of the management.</p>
<p>However, in order to fit into the Latino marketplace, a company must not give up its long term goals.  In fact, it should make the changes necessary while keeping its long term goal in mind. A lot of businesses have opted for this strategy in the Latino marketplace and has become immensely successful.</p>
