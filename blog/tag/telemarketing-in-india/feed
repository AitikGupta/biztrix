Nearly half of the US business enterprises outsource to Indian call centers. And it is particularly the <strong><a title="telemarketing in India" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/">telemarketing in India</a></strong> that has flourished like anything.</p>
<p>Given the efficiency and the inexpensiveness of the service, the responsibility of telemarketing can be blindly entrusted on any Indian call centers. And your company can experience rapid growth from such telemarketing endeavors put in by an eminent call center service provider.</p>
<p>Besides being the champions in telemarketing, Indian call centers are beneficial form other aspects too:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2666.png" alt="♦" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Money is a factor. Because labor in India is pretty cheap when compared to the US labor rates, this brings down the overall operational costs substantially.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2666.png" alt="♦" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The fluency in speaking English and the clear accent of the Indian population also adds to the appeal of the call centers in the region.</p>

The time difference with US is of exact 12 hours. This turns out to be really convenient in conducting the telemarketing campaigns. Also telemarketing in India is conducted in two- or three shift operations only to ensure that such campaign runs 24/7.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="&quot;lightbox&quot;&quot;" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/telemarketing.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4384" title="telemarketing in india" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/telemarketing-300x296.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="296" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/telemarketing-300x296.jpg 300w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/telemarketing.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Lack of common sense and sound judgment skills are considered to be the doom for telemarketing outsourcing call centers. When outbound call centers strategically plan telemarketing outsourcing services, they must use their common sense generously as that alone will stand the businesses in good stead and enable them and will also help the marketing endeavors of telemarketing in India cal centers succeed to a great extent.</p>
<p>Common sense must be applied by the telemarketing outsourcing call centers for finding out if the market is viable before the products and services of businesses can be launched. The telemarketing in India services must also chalk out the action that the businesses expect customers to take before implementation of the marketing tactics and strategies.</p>
<p>Telemarketing in India call centers must also maintain a budget for time that is spent on marketing tools and activities. It is also a good idea to increase the prices if the costs have increased. It will make sense for the telemarketing call centers to find out the strengths as well as weaknesses of their client’s competitors; this way the <strong><a title="telemarketing in india" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/">telemarketing in India</a></strong> call center agents will be able to best capitalize on the weaknesses of competitors and defend against the strengths of the rival companies.</p>
<p>Telemarketing also requires the agents to have a plan ready so that they know what to achieve, how to achieve and also know the deadline to achieve it. When marketing products and services, it is unwise for businesses to think that they know all about the attitudes and behaviors of customers, as these are customer attributes that can change with time.</p>
