								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Appointment setting is a voice over the process and one of the core telemarketing services that we provide at Fusion BPO. We make it a point that our team spends more than 20,000 hours to provide eminent telemarketing services.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we constantly evolve and improve our telemarketing processes. Rapid deployment of the new strategies and tools helps to bring notable difference in the nurturing of qualified B2B leads. We are proud of expertise and experience that our agents have, and hence we thought to share top 10 Tips that keep our team members focused.</p>
<p>Why do we call our appointment setting campaigns “<em>Unique</em>”? There are major reasons to tag it. Let us share the reasons that will enable you to stay on top of the game.</p>
<h3>1. Do You Know Who Your Target Audience Is?</h3>
<p>When you start the campaign, it is essential to know who your target audience is. Successful telemarketing needs careful planning, and recognizing your target audience is a part of the game. Spend some time thinking where is your target market, which people will feel interested in your products and services, what sector they work in etc. As soon as you define your target audience, soon you start getting better dividends from the appointment setting campaigns.</p>
<h3>2. A Lot of Brainstorming Needs To Be Done When You Process the Call</h3>
<p>When you set a new marketing strategy, like changing segment in the appointment setting campaign, make sure that you discuss it with your telemarketing team. This enables you to identify the challenges, which your agents might face during the implementation.</p>
<h3>3. Get Ready For the Call</h3>
<p>We do make sure that our agents are well prepared before they pick up the phone to speak with the customers. You might use a telemarketing script or a call flow, but determining a strategic opening line is necessary. It is essential for the agents to know products and service details, which they are going to offer over the phone. Potential customers are hard to convince if your agent is ill prepared.</p>
<h3>4. Do Make Sure That You Are Speaking To the Decision Maker</h3>
<p>At times, our telemarketer faces this problem. Our agent calls up, goes through the entire sales pitch and then discovers that they are not conversing with the decision maker. Making a sales pitch to the improper persons is simply wastage of time.</p>
<p>The person who is going to take the final decision is easy to convince. Hence, agents must understand the marketing chain and clarify the role of the person with whom they are talking.</p>
<h3>5. You Need To Be Specific About the Campaign Details/Offers/Services</h3>
<p>We know that the decision makers are quite busy, so agents have to churn potential results from the minimal time. To draw interest of the decision maker, our agents quickly establish the purpose of their calling, the product they are going to offer and build a quick rapport with the customer. Retaining your own persona helps the decision maker to engage in conversation on easier terms.</p>
<p>Decision makers receive such telemarketing calls every day, and hence they are skilled enough to detect the false voices. Injecting your own persona will help to pay better dividends.</p>
<h3>6. Listen to What Your Customer Says</h3>
<p>In the opening part of the sales call, the customer is communicating about his or her valuable information. This information helps the telemarketers to establish interest in the decision maker about the product and services they offer.</p>
<p>Listening is a powerful skill to grow rapport with the prospective customer. Fusion asks to indulge in conversation and not in a question-answer session with your potential customer.</p>
<h3>7. Recognize the Needs and Match Them with Your Customer Benefits</h3>
<p>It is important to make out what are the current needs of your customer. However, business has their ongoing issues and people would like to address them. If you have targeted the right customer, then your product is going to satisfy the immediate needs of the decision maker.</p>
<p>As we identify the business needs, our telemarketer places a particular product that can quickly resolve the decision maker’s issue. This generates better revenue that any other strategy you might implement.</p>
<h3>8. Objections Are the Good Old Friends of a Telemarketer</h3>
<p>For inexperienced telemarketers, objections are instant reaction. Hence, they automatically shut the call and proceeds to next. However, remember an objection is not rejection. When a potential customer raises objection, it indicates that they feel interested to discuss the details of the product/services. That is a way for customers to seek more information from the telemarketer.</p>
<p>Fusion and its telemarketers are capable enough to use every opportunity and emphasize the product strength, and never let a chance to demonstrate the depth of product knowledge.</p>
<h3>9. Shed Coyness While Closing the Deal</h3>
<p>It is important for the telemarketer to remember their objective. When you deliver the sales appointment, do not be afraid to close the deal. The decision makers expect to have an appointment offer at this point of time. Therefore, your telemarketer needs to take control of the conversation at this stage. If the prospective customers send the alternatives or are vague over the availability, then bring them back by suggesting specific dates.</p>
<h3>10. At the End You Need To Summarize Everything</h3>
<p>Ambiguity is the main cause behind confusion, and that can lead both customers and telemarketer to different opinions. The telemarketers should summarize the conversation with the decision maker and avoid confusion. Confirm the appointment date, sum up the benefits, offers, how it solves the particular business issues and time to meet. Make sure that the telemarketer and the customer are well aware of the next step.</p>
<p>As a marketer, you need to ascertain that the appointment setting campaign is able to meet the challenges posed by time and fluctuating market needs. Fusion can say that these 10 tips will improve the quality of your B2B telemarketing campaigns and thus boost your sales teams’ performance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the telemarketing business, we know that everyone tries to make a few calls and boost the business at one go. The phone is the ultimate source to gather, quality leads.</p>
<p>Outsourcing contact centers produces lead for the insurance agents or brokers through the advanced telemarketing tactics and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/lead-generation.html">lead generation services.</a> At <em>Fusion</em>, our clients get exclusive leads so that they can stay in front of the clients closing business.</p>
<p>The only way to get better insurance leads is to employ the outsourced telemarketing services and sail on the same boat as the competitors. Check out how <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/telemarketing-services.html">outsource telemarketing companies</a> help the insurance agents gain powerful leads in 5 easy steps.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Agents Must Say – Why They Are Calling?</h3>
<p>In the first 20 seconds, most calls are either booked or lost. The agents are aware that they are interrupting the caller. Therefore, at the call center three rules for opening the calls are seriously followed:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Giving a self-introduction to the customer</i></li>
<li><i>Impressing them through a compelling statement</i></li>
<li><i>Ending with an open-ended question</i></li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 2: Avoid Talking At Length in the Opening</h3>
<p>At contact centers, the telemarketing agent simply engages the prospect in a conversation. On the common question of how or why, the customers ideally replies, that they are seeking the particular solution. However, agents never make a mistake to talk at lengths in the beginning of the call. An opening call of 7-minute length is surely going to turn a customer irate. Therefore, this rule is strictly followed by the telemarketing agents as a step ahead to gather quality leads.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Agents Should Never Say That They Are Selling a Product</h3>
<p>Yes, this is the most important approach that a telemarketing agent maintains. This aspect is another assured step to success. Agents know what they are going to sell. They generally sell an appointment and until they sold it, they won’t sell your product. At Fusion, we advice our agents not to make the mistake of going into deeper conversation until they <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/life-insurance-appointment-setting-service-quality-life-insurance-leads.html">make the appointment secured</a> for the clients. Once the customers agree to meet, our agent clarifies the address, phone, e-mail, etc. to ease the task for the insurance agents.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Qualifying the Appointment</h3>
<p>The agents make sure that they hit on something in which the customer feels interested. It is the time to find out whether it matches up the insurance agent’s requirement or not. Agents never beg for appointment or take an appointment where the decision makers are absent. They do not waste time with meetings that are not likely to turn into a sale.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Slowing Down, Listening Carefully and Reading Out the Script</h3>
<p>Agents make sure that they stay calm when they place the call for particular customers on behalf of the insurance agents. Next step is to turn in a good listener, as listening is the hot button to success. Agents in reputed contact centers takes notes on what customers are saying, why customer chose the competitors or why they are not able to meet.</p>
<p>Finally, the telemarketing agent sticks to a script while they handle a campaign. Fusion is counted among the reputed lead generation companies for US, which at every step make sure that the insurance agent gets exclusive leads for turning them into potential customers.</p>
<p><b><i>Hit it!</i></b> The contact centers make sure that they “<b><i>Sell the Appointments and Not Products</i></b><i>”</i> over the phone. Agents make sure that they close the appointment and the appointment only! This in turn makes the insurance agents and the broker succeed.</p>
