								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Live answering service call centers usually have a team of talented copywriters who design a call controlling script for the agents at the centers to follow. Agents are trained to follow the script so that they do not make mistakes and do not forget instructing or telling customers about something that they must know. However, when agents are naturally conversing with customers having the call controlling script just as a guide, they deliver better customer satisfaction levels.</p>
<p>Often agents at a telephone answering service may seem to be very dumb as these agents seem to read directly from the scripts without actually caring about and understanding what the customers have to say. Just merely reading from scripts will make <strong><a title="live answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">live answering service</a></strong> agents sound highly mechanical and like complete idiots. The customers might not be interested in paying attention to what these ‘robots’ have to say.</p>
<p>The agents that the customers are speaking o are expected to have high levels of intelligence, common sense and even traits of human emotion. Over scripting is not a good thing in telephone answering service call centers; often agents forget that the script is just a guide and they follow it word for word. The agents are trained to render a personal touch to the conversations so that the customers may be interested in talking to them without hanging up. It is better if the agents take the name of the customers and refer to them while talking.</p>
<p>If customers would want to hear robots, they would not have opted to talk to live agents, so agents must behave like real persons.</p>

The numbers might also be provided on offline paper forms at stores and restaurants, which needs to be verified. Telephone answering service agents need to learn if the phone numbers are existent and working. The name of the owner of the number must also match with the name provided on the online or offline business form.</p>
<p>The main purpose of having this phone verification is to authenticate the credential of the individuals. Phone verification is a must for banking sectors, credit card issuers, as well as for ID proof; these firms hire telephone answering service call center for verifying the phone numbers. Phone verification is also seen as a way to decrease several unproductive calls by tele-callers considerably.</p>
<p><strong>How does the IVR system work in this case?</strong></p>
<p>When prospects enter phone numbers on the online and offline registration forms, they are provided a number that they have to dial from the number they have provided on the form. As soon as the phone rings, the call is disconnected and the Caller ID is captured without charging the caller for the call. The Caller ID is then matched with the phone number provided in the form. This enables the verification of the phone number and the registration will also be accepted.</p>
