								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“I will not be just a tourist in the world of images, just watching images passing by which I cannot live in, make love to, possess as permanent sources of joy and ecstasy.”</em> – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana%C3%AFs_Nin" target="_blank">Anais Nin</a></p>
<p>Travel and tourism is the trendiest industry and people all over the world like to invest upon it. In this travel and tourism industry, there has been a current trend of Timeshare realties, which has become popular by late 90’s.</p>
<p>Timeshare is a competitive package for the holidaymakers. Here, they are going to have an access to an impressive line of hotel brands for the customers to enjoy their holidays. If you are an average holidaymaker, then you have ample of choice to select from the Timeshare.</p>

<p>For this, the timeshare companies often have to face these four challenges:</p>
<ul>
