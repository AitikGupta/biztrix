								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have been in the business for nine years and we have stitched a beautiful relationship in our workspace down the hierarchy from starting from manager to sales agent.</p>
<p>Fusion BPO has turned many agents into a great team leads, and we believe that becoming a great leader needs time and development in skills. If you choose the wrong person, then it will have a domino effect and can make your entire team anxious and overwhelmed.</p>
<p>When we look for great team leads in our workspace, we make sure that the Fusionite possesses few qualities in particular, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eagerness to take initiative</li>
<li>Sense of responsibility</li>
<li>Needs to be caring and bold</li>
<li>Should possess strong training skills</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Initiative</strong></h3>
<p>Initiative is the quality that helps a leader to analyze the situation and take proper action against it to reach a solution. Taking initiative is a crucial characteristic that a quality team leader must possess.</p>
<p>Fusionite with such a quality generally does not wait for a second opinion, when it comes to the right execution of the sudden problems that can arise at any time in their department. They are people who can give prompt answers to the tricky questions as their mind is ready to accept any solutions. These people are able to help their team members and solve their problem individually to strengthen the company one strand at a time.</p>
<p>Every business has different crunch time. Thus, it is important to have team leaders who can add some spring to the actions.</p>
<h3>Responsible</h3>
<p>Before we make an individual the new team leader for any process, it is important to pinpoint what is their level of responsibility. The team leaders are in charge of the company, and it is important other team members can rely.</p>
<p>Well, at Fusion we follow one of the easiest ways to spot the responsible team leader is to assess them based on &#8211; what they say they will do and will they take all the responsibility if the team fails.</p>
<p>For example, if someone says that they can crack the project by investing large time, the entire team will feel the heat if they fail to arrive on time. They will also feel the vibe to finish off the things sooner rather than later.</p>
<h3>Caring &amp; Daring</h3>
<p>Team leaders are those who do not let their personal benefit get in the way of the good management of the team. It is important to care other team members while staying bold and extrovert. Team lead is in charge of some part of the company and must set an example for what people expects of them out of their duties.</p>
<p>There are leaders who keep a strict eye on the statistical aspects and can easily give up on employees who keep on struggling rather than taking the time to train them eventually.</p>
<p>At Fusion, bold and caring team leads goes out of their way and make sure that all other team member comes under his or her wings.</p>
<h3>Robust Training Skills</h3>
<p>Technology has been taking giant leaps and bounds, and a strong team leader makes use of these resources when it comes to train their team members.</p>
<p>In the past, there were few resources and the training restricted to classroom lecture or on the spot training with a seasoned employee.</p>
<p>Today we have innovative ways to train people. Team leaders with knowledge and enthusiasm come up with updated sales enablement tools. These programs help in quickly recognizing the opportunities and save time in closing the sales.</p>
<p>We live in a highly competitive market and thus it important to assess the skills of the management team. We need to identify an employee who can take initiatives, is responsible, caring and robust and possess strong training skills becomes a great asset for the company.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we have many such valuable assets and preserve them to uplift our team orientation at every stage of the campaign.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is never a better time to train the contact center staff.</p>
<p>You will come across agent training tips in the contact center websites and expert comments from the various call center managers. However, all stresses on the key factor – <i>“</i><i><strong>training of employees is a key point for any organization</strong>.”</i></p>
<p>Initial training of the agents on all equipments consist of different aspects of soft skills like &#8211; communication, empathy, and the ability to convey the message in a clear and understandable way to the client.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the contact center supervisors need to initiate training focused on the product issues. As the clients, who come to outsource their business need to know, that the contact center will provide them with proper customer support and sales of their products and services.</p>
<p>Knowing this theory is not going to win bigger opportunities for you. Rather, you have to speculate measures and make the training sessions effective.</p>
<p>Fusion like other contact center services includes the practice in training and has training labs to stimulate the learners. The call center needs a set of tools to give an opportunity to the advisor to interact with the agents properly and simulate them for future processes. If the agents fail to achieve the quality standards and operational levels, then the advisor must continue with the training sessions.</p>
<p>The majority of contact center company is of the opinion that successful customer relationship lies in training and motivating their team.</p>
<h3><i>Training Your Agent with Appropriate Contact Center Technology</i><b><i> </i></b></h3>
<p>When we talk about agent training in the contact center field, we have to carry a statistic in our hand. The wide quoted statistics says that, 20% of the people remember what they hear, 30% of what they see. Combining these two aspects, the ratio becomes 50%.</p>
<p>Making people aware of what they need to do, along with retention of information, scales up to 70% and more. Studies show that people learn fast when they participate in an activity.</p>
<p>Call centers must stress on a motto while they take on to train their agents – “each <i>day will be a better day than the previous,”</i> to set confidence and zeal among their agents. Weekly routine sessions are a constant ritual that is going to give agents a chance to show where they are heading. It will also help them to move the operating levers and find a suitable path for effective customer support.</p>
<p>We have recognized that agent training takes time, and time costs money. However, we have developed ways of training that can be delivered in the workplace using the idle time.</p>
<p><b><i>Making the Agents Remember What They Need to Say</i></b> &#8211; set this trend in your contact center to leverage befitting services to customers and clients. Deploy live, call quality monitoring and phrase to make your agents well equipped.</p>
<p>The adoption of such a solution would allow agents to enjoy the benefit collectively and have their own private mentor and trainer sitting on their shoulder. Thus, agent will be able to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>What they must say to the customers</li>
<li>What they forgot to say to the customers</li>
<li>Where they are wrong in their approach</li>
<li>Whether they were speaking too loud or too soft, too fast or too slow</li>
</ul>
<p>All the agents need to aim for  customer happiness and not just for customer satisfaction at the end of every call. Thus, enabling a flexible agent training campaign is must for all the major call center companies.</p>
