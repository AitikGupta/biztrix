								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last year we have seen social media emerge as one of the most prominent customer service channels. Consumers today are more prone to use social media to communicate their questions, compliments, or complaints with businesses. According to <a href="https://blog.sprinklr.com/5-stats-social-media-customer-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Sprinklr</a>, 80% of consumers engage with brands online, and 54% of customers prefer social messaging channels for care instead of phone or email. And that means customers today expect companies to have a strong social customer service channel round the clock.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-things-customer-service-should-monitor-on-social-media.html">Social customer service</a> is rapidly maturing as a customer service channel.  Here are a few customer service trends that have dominated social media in 2018 and will continue to do so in 2019.</p>



<h3>1. More people using direct messages</h3>



<p>More consumers are connecting with companies through direct
messaging (Twitter) and Facebook messenger rather than tagging them on social
media posts. This way, consumers can upload photos, videos, and sensitive
personal information while communicating with a business without broadcasting
it to the world. It has also become easier to control the damage.</p>



<h3>2. Customer care bots will continue to rise</h3>



<p>Customer care bots, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-chatbots-reshaping-customer-service-kishore-saraogi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="chatbots (opens in a new tab)">chatbots</a>, allow companies to offer round the clock, automated replies that can instantly help customers fix a technical issue or even order their lunch. While chatbots can be the quick-and-easy and cost-effective solutions to common queries, it can deliver e less-than-satisfactory experience when implemented without a strategy. </p>



<p>The truth is, chatbots are still evolving and has a long way to go before it can provide a communication similar to real- life interaction. Yet, experts have high hopes for this customer care According to a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/09/chatbots-expected-to-cut-business-costs-by-8-billion-by-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="report (opens in a new tab)">report</a>, chatbots could cut business costs by $8 billion by 2022.</p>



<h3>3. Social care strategies getting more personal</h3>



<p>Stepping in 2019, we are seeing that more brands are
adopting their social media customer care strategies, and are gravitating
towards personalization. Companies today are focusing more and more towards
personalization, active conversation through messaging in a casual tone using
emojis. Once perfected, social care strategies will start providing
personalized care for a fraction of the cost of traditional customer care channels.</p>



<h3>4. Customer care agents are using social data</h3>



<p>Marketing and PR departments have long used social data to
influence decisions, but now customer care teams are using it to shape
interactions. Today it is easy to use technology to track both positive and negative
mentions and reply quickly.&nbsp; This way a
company can show how much they care. </p>



<p>Social data is also helping social customer care agents to
know more about the customer and shape their interactions according to it. For
example &#8211; if your customers are talking about how you can use less plastic in
packaging your product, you can use this opportunity to tell them about your
eco-friendly efforts and what steps are being used to reduce plastic usage. You
can also use the same data to change your social advertisement patterns.</p>



<h3>5. Customer care is the new marketing</h3>



<p>With consumer interactions more public, customer care is
becoming the new marketing. While one cannot replace the other — they can work
side by side to bring their customers the best of both worlds.&nbsp; When a company does an excellent job in
taking care of public and personal messages on social media, words spread
faster, resulting in more business. 

These are some of the most popular social media
customer service trends that are going to take the customer service space by
storm in 2019.

<p>While call center management is a mammoth task, following the latest and most innovative trends can help a call center keep delivering quality customer service to its customers. And while trends come and go with each passing year, only the most effective ones can help a call center improve. </p>



<p>As 2019 is approaching, one must look into the call center trends that will have a big impact on call centers the coming year. </p>



<h2>Trend 1: Customer Experience is of Prime Importance</h2>



<p>By now every call center should be aware of the power of a positive customer experience. </p>



<p>From the biggest corporations to the smallest businesses today know that a poor customer experience is all it takes to lose a customer forever while consistent bad service can ruin any business for good, especially with so many competitors around.</p>



<p>On the other hand, customers today are willing to pay more for better service. According to one <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/RightNow/2011-customer-experience-impact-report">survey</a> 86% of buyers would part with 25% extra cash if another company treated them better.</p>



<p>For this reason, customer experience has become an important aspect that call centers can no longer ignore. On the contrary, they are placing more and more emphasis on treating each caller to the highest standard of service to ensure repeat business. </p>



<h2>Trend 2: The Importance of First Call Resolution </h2>



<p>First call resolution is great for both the call center and the customers alike. </p>



<p>For this, agents should be encouraged to get the first call right. While there will be calls that are more difficult to resolve than others, it’s important to provide customers with the very best quality of care possible every single time.</p>



<p>Monitoring call center agents’ interactions with customers will help a business identify mistakes that leaves the caller unsatisfied and/or frustrated.  With proper identification and training such problems can be avoided in future. </p>



<h2>Trend 3: Social Network is an Important Customer Service Channel</h2>



<p>Social networks like Facebook and Twitter continue to become a key channel in customer service.</p>



<p>As an alternative to calling or emailing, prospective and existing buyers can contact a business’s support team through their social accounts. Call centers should be incorporating this aspect of the customer experience into their operations to make sure that the consumers can reach them on as many channels as possible.</p>



<p>Handling queries through various social media channels can actually be the fastest method. However, as the conversation takes place in a public forum, one must bear the best practices in mind.  On social media quick and efficient responses are the key. Ignoring this channel, on the other hand, can ruin a company’s brand reputation. </p>



<h2>Trend 4: Every Channel Matters</h2>



<p>Customers today expect companies to respond through the same channel they use to interact with the company. So, if they interact with a call center via phone or chat, they would not appreciate the company replying through email.</p>



<p>Therefore, call centers should be ready to incorporate that aspect of customer experience into their operation and give equal importance to all customer interaction channels.  Only then they will be able to provide the customers with the multi-channel customer service that modern customers deserve.</p>



<h2>Trend 5: Employee Management</h2>



<p>Most of the time call centers fail to meet customer’s needs due to disengaged agents who lack power and freedom to improvise or take a decision. Therefore, empowering the agents with knowledge, giving them some decision making freedom and engaging them through a reward-based culture is very important. A company can also arrange for interim training wherever needed to train their agents better.</p>



<p>These are some of the most important call center trends that will help a call center to become successful in 2019 and beyond. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today contact center industry is one of the most prominent industries in the world. Almost every company today has a contact center and millions from across the world are associated with this industry.</p>
<p>But we all know that contact center industry can be somewhat tumultuous and unpredictable at times.  And so, in order to survive, you need to pay close attention to the recent trends in this industry. And the best way to so is to look at some insightful statistics.</p>
<p>These statistics will not only help you understand the recent trends in every aspect of the industry, analyzing and  evaluating which, you can  have an idea about the future strategy of your contact centers.</p>
<p>In this blog, we bring you 25 important stats that will shed some light on 6 different aspects of the contact center industry. We have also included our own opinion based on these stats. We hope that you will find these helpful.</p>
<h3><strong>Customer Experience</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1)</strong> With 60% often/always paying more for a better experience, customer experience is a high priority for consumers even in a negative economy. (Source: <a href="https://www.oracle.com/applications/customer-experience/service/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Harris Interactive</a>)</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> In past 4 years, the percentage of consumers who stopped doing business with a company as a result of a bad customer experience, have risen from 59% to 86%. (Source: <a href="https://www.oracle.com/applications/customer-experience/service/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Harris Interactive</a>)</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> After a poor customer experience, 89% consumers began doing business with a competitor. (Source: <a href="https://www.oracle.com/applications/customer-experience/service/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Harris Interactive</a>)</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> In the same situation, 59% will try a new brand or company in anticipation of better service experience. (Source: <a href="http://about.americanexpress.com/news/docs/2011x/AXP_2011_csbar_market.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">American Express</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Our Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Customer Service should not be taken lightly. Today, customers today are choosier and more discerning. If your quality of customer service is poor, you are sure to lose key customers to your competitors. Interestingly, most of these customers are willing to pay more for a superior customer experience and service.</p>
<h3><strong>Self-Service and Call Automation</strong></h3>
<p><strong>5)</strong> By 2020, the customer will be able to maintain 85% of the relationship with a company without interacting with a human. (Source: <a href="http://mktimages.gartner.com/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_92DB197B681D1A1003F701CB30B626FF3B111B00/filename/brochure_crm_2011.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gartner</a>)</p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> US contact centers spend $12.4 billion annually verifying the caller is who they say they are. 59% of calls require identity verification, but only 3% of these are handled entirely through automated processes. (Source: <a href="http://www.contactbabel.com/reports.cfm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ContactBabel</a>)</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> The IVR amount to 27% of the total call experience. However, currently only 7% of organizations offer an IVR solution that delivers a superior experience (CSAT) than their live agent solution. (Source: <a href="http://www.howto.gov/sites/default/files/the-drivers-of-customer-satisfaction-in-the-contact-center.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JD Power &amp; Associates</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Our Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Self-service is the future of customer service. As customers’ preferences are changing rapidly, they expect and demand immediate service and superior experience. These days, customers expect almost instant gratification and to do so, they have the necessary tools at their fingertips that help them stay in touch with the contact center through multiple communication channels. They don’t want to wait on hold and to repeat their information.</p>
<p>To stay in the competition you will need to live up to the customers’ expectations and needs for self service and instant gratification. And the only way to do so is to apply artificial intelligence to self-service.</p>
<h3><strong>Quality and Performance Management</strong></h3>
<p><strong>8)</strong> Only 31% of companies strictly monitor the quality of relations with target customers. (Source: <a href="http://www.forrester.com/The+Customer+Experience+Index+2010/fulltext/-/E-RES55833?docid=55833" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Forrester Research</a>)</p>
<p><strong>9)</strong> 67% of organizations see access to real-time or near real-time metrics as a very important capability. However, only a few companies (8%) get access to their metrics as soon as they are generated. Fewer than 18% receive them on the same day, while the remaining companies it get it within four weeks. (Source: <a href="http://www.ventanaresearch.com/research/benchmarkDetail.aspx?id=608" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ventana Research</a>)</p>
<p><strong>10)</strong> 60% of all repeat calls are process or training driven.  I most cases, business processes are not in position to meet the customer’s need, as agents are not given the training required to meet the customer expectations set by marketing or elsewhere in the business. (Source: <a href="http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/cpo/142334235" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Frost &amp; Sullivan</a>)</p>
<p><strong>11)</strong> Organizations that focus on frequent training reap the benefits in first call resolution &#8211; 65% first call resolution instead of 58% for those who have frequent trainings. (Source: <a href="http://www.parature.com/find-resources/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Parature</a>)</p>
<p><strong>12)</strong> Only 31% of businesses recognize and reward employees for improving customer experience. (Source: <a href="http://www.forrester.com/The+Customer+Experience+Index+2010/fulltext/-/E-RES55833?docid=55833" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Forrester Research</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Our Opinion</strong></p>
<p>These stats show that when it comes to agent quality and performance management, the companies have a long way to go. They need to maximize the potential of every employee and provide the training needed.</p>
<p>To get more value from Quality Assurance efforts, organizations should rethink approach to Quality Assurance (QA). Analytics-driven QA will deliver insight into critical business issues as well as opportunities to improve customer experience and revenue generation.</p>
<h3><strong>Multi-Channel</strong></h3>
<p><strong>13)</strong> Contact channels except the phone, for example, &#8211; email, Web self-service, chat, as well as other online techniques account for over 30% of customer service engagements today. Web self-service and email are the two prominent contact channels next to phone. (Source: <a href="http://cfigroup.com/resources/white-papers/call-center-satisfaction-index-2012-ccsi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CFI Group</a>)</p>
<p><strong>14)</strong> In the US, 21% of online shoppers favor live chat, almost the same number as those who prefer using the telephone (23%).  The number is way ahead of social media (2%). Email however, still remains the most popular mode of communication for online shoppers, with 54% saying they prefer this method to talk to customer service. (Source: <a href="http://www.boldchat.com/live-chat-research.asp?x=Live-Chat-Effectivness-2012" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BoldChat</a> )</p>
<p><strong>15)</strong> 60% of adults aged 25–29 live in households where they only have wireless telephones. (Source: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/wireless201112.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Centers for Disease Control</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Our Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Contact centers are using different channels to reach their customers nowadays. In this age of constant communication, customers expect to be able to interact with a company via any channel –phone, web, live chat or email. If companies can put more stress on gaining the extract insights from self-service, Web chat, email and social media conversations. It can lead us into speech and text analytics.</p>

<p><strong>17)</strong> Speech analytics was one of the top two fastest-growing call center tools in 2012.  The adoption of the software grew by 59% and Web chat grew by 60%. (Source: <a href="http://www.contactbabel.com/reports.cfm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ContactBabel</a>)</p>
<p><strong>18)</strong> The speech analytics market is projected to continue to expand over the next several years, growing by 25 percent in 2013 and 20 percent in 2014. (Source: <a href="http://www.dmgconsult.com/services/speechreport.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DMG Consulting</a>)</p>
<p><strong>19)</strong> Speech analytics solutions are currently in use in 24% of all organizations, predominantly used by services, outsourcing and finance organizations. There is an appreciable amount of interest in implementing a new speech analytics system or replacing the one they have within the near future, especially in the medical sector (45% of companies), insurance sector (54%) and retail (40%). (Source: <a href="http://www.contactbabel.com/reports.cfm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ContactBabel</a>)</p>
<p><strong>What these Speech Analytics Statistics Say about the Future of Contact Centers?</strong></p>
<p>These statistics show that speech analytics may be the fastest growing trend that will impact the future of contact centers.

<p><strong>21)</strong> Failure to respond via social channels can lead to up to a 15% increase in churn rate for existing customers. (Source: <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2101515" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gartner</a>)</p>
<p><strong>22)</strong> About 56% of customer tweets to companies are ignored. (Source: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-honigman/100-fascinating-social-me_b_2185281.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Huffington Post </a> “<em>100 Fascinating Social Media Statistics and Figures from 2012&#8243;</em>)</p>
<p><strong>23)</strong> 19% of consumers who had unsatisfactory service interactions shared their experiences through social networks in 2010, a 50% increase over 2009. (Source: <a href="http://www.forrester.com/North+American+Technographics+Customer+Experience+Online+Survey+Q4+2012+US/-/E-SUS1751" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Forrester</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Our Opinion</strong></p>
<p>Social Media is likely to have a huge impact on the future of the contact center industry. After interacting with your company, a customer can immediately vent their frustrations or share their positive experiences at just a click of a button and the whole world knows about it. This is why customer service you provide is more important than ever before.  Responding <a href="http://www.sociableblog.com/2013/11/11/strengthen-your-relationships-on-social-media-to-gain-success/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">regularly</a> to your customers’ requests and comments on social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, blogs and others is a good strategy.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Statistics Indicate one thing, and one thing only – You need to get ready to change with time.</strong></em></p>
<p>In the contact center industry, it’s vital to be well prepared and practical. On the whole, these statistics can show you that the future of contact centers is changing fast. In order to survive, you must be willing to adhere to these changes.</p>
