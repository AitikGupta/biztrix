								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Call centers have migrated towards the IPS (Internet Phone Services) over the years, do you know? Why call centers trying to have a leap from the traditional phones?  Just for two reasons – limited features and the installation charges are comparatively high.</p>
<p>With a broadband internet connection, they are getting advanced communication features. Medium to small call centers make 70% of these huge purchases as compared to the big business owners.</p>
<p>Since, communication is the lifeblood of the call centers irrespective of their size, so BPO executives are reluctant to adopt innovative technologies that will increase their productivity and popularity gradually.</p>
<p>It was in the 1990s that VoIP started to grow, and now it is the highly reliable solution for the call centers pertaining to an outstanding call quality. The VoIP are hosted by a reliable service provider and are cheaper than the traditional phone systems. Doesn’t that sound good? No installation charge, no long distance charges, you are just going to save a lot on your phone bill.</p>
<p>Here, in this article Fusionites are going to share the surefire ways by which the installation of VoIP helps call centers to save money.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>It becomes easier to reduce the PBX maintenance and upgrade costs</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You have to maintain older telephones based on the PBX systems at frequent intervals to ensure proper functioning. Call centers have to operate the system at their own self, which at times is quite expensive. Have you ever calculated that you spend around 75% of your operation cost to system administration and technical support? While the rest 25% is spent on security management, insurance, power, planning etc.</p>
<p>As soon as you switch over to a hosted VoIP solution, you can just dismantle the OBX. No maintenance charge, as your service provider is going to take all the responsibility. You have to pay an affordable monthly fee that allows managing the long-term cost. When VoIP will need an upgrade, the service provider will push it out to the system adding charges to monthly fees. (You have to pay quite a nominal amount)</p>
<p>Moreover, you can also eliminate the consultant fees and thus your IT staff can focus on the business initiatives instead of looking over those outdated phone systems.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fusion’s Advice: Bid goodbye to those PBX that spoils hours after hours for general upgrade. It&#8217;s time to change your call center outlook with hosted VoIP solutions from today. </em></strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Hosted solution enables quick changes</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You know that the traditional PBX is difficult to change and grow. You might end up purchasing more than you need. When you do not need to add employees or change the set up, you have to pay additional charges to the service provider, or have to hire the outside consultant to have the transition.</p>
<p>VoIP solution is such an instant cloud-hosted solution, where you can make changes anytime. Sometimes providers give you the passage to add lines simply by logging into the users account. You do not need to move the employee from one place to another, just plug and unplug the phone.</p>
<p>Web-based management system is easy to set up and modify into the auto groups, voicemail boxes, and other features. And guess what, you do not need to contract or hire an IT consultant for that.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fusion’s Advice: Great aspect that call center owners will love to embrace, the self-managing capability and easy administration.</em></strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>It helps to lower the monthly phone bill</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many call centers distribute their workforce according to the customer base. It means, you have to get a separate phone system at different locations, including tools, long distance calls, international calls etc. You have to manage mass bills with various local and long distance service providers. You are certainly going to get confused under such a chaotic situation.</p>
<p>When you migrate to a hosted VoIP solution, you are going to reduce all the cost and can streamline the service contracts. As the hosted solution gives you the opportunity to unite all the locations and workers under the same telephony system, so you can cut back a large amount on your monthly bills.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fusion’s Advice: Pay just 10% of the bill that you used to pay the months before installation.</em></strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Reduce the long distance charges</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The use of cell phones for business calls is at times expensive especially when you have to make long distance calls. Just by installing the Hosted VoIP solution, you can reduce the call charges to a comparative low price.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fusion’s Advice: Reduce the monthly bill even if you make international calls. Global call center will love to embrace this technology.</em></strong></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3>Enhanced phone features helps to boost the productivity</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The call centers earlier had the premises-based PBX that came with basic features like voicemail and call forwarding. Only big call center were able to afford the state-of-the-art call center technologies with features like auto dialing, extension dialing, auto attendants, email notification of the voicemails, mobile apps and corporate directories.</p>
<p>With the advent of VoIP technology, features got sharper, and price got cheaper, isn&#8217;t that good? More than just the convenience, the VoIP phones have a positive impact on the employee productivity and the workflow efficiency. You can have double savings: you will pay less for the better phone service and rich phone features will improve your productivity.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fusion’s Advice: Stay connected 24/7, that’s VoIP assure.</em></strong></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3>Merging all the phone and conference services</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Well this primarily one of the important thing that call center adopt to reduce the travel and training cost. They use audio conference bridges and web conferencing services. These are some of the ancillary services, which are less expensive than travelling, but add up hundreds of dollars to the monthly communication cost.</p>
<p>The hosted VoIP solutions help you to merge the telephone and the conferencing services, and for that, you need to pay just one affordable monthly fee to your provider.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fusion’s Advice: Say Adieu to the maintenance of the premise-based PBXs.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Let’s Hit the Bottomline</strong></p>
<p>What will be the bottomline when it comes to the installation of VoIP solution in the call center premises? Well, if you stick to the traditional PBX you have to pay a lot for a limited number of features. Therefore, the Fortune 500 companies have made quick profits by shifting to the use of VoIP.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we have benefited a lot and have improved the workflow and productivity at the same time. We are giving promising results to our clients and most important rewarding them with happy prospects.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a part of the eminent call center we stay focused on the networks and their ability to handle the real-time data. We have to assess from time to time whether our network is able to handle the real-time protocol (RTP) traffic, to gather highly sensitive data.</p>
<p>Once you decide that the network can handle more, and then you have to evaluate the quality of calls and troubleshoot the voice quality issues.</p>
<p>While troubleshooting real-time data like VoIP, you need to have the right analysis tool and search the granular details of the traffic. You need to have the tools for focusing quickly on telephony calls and quality.</p>
<h3>MOS and R-Factor – Automated Measurement of Call Quality</h3>
<p>In order to evaluate the relative quality of a call, contact centers use <a class="zem_slink" title="Mean opinion score" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_opinion_score" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Mean Opinion Score</a> (MOS). For years, Fusion has used it in their landlines, where we ask our agents to listen to telephone calls and we rate the call quality from 1 to 5. If the VoIP calls are above 3.5 rating then we receive few complaints.</p>
<p>Human perception and the mathematical analysis by R – Factor helps to understand the call quality in a better way. Moreover, as the VoIP Codec have become better, it is possible for the calls to have an R-Factor greater than 100.</p>
<p>Jitter is another factor that measures the time delay between each RTP packet. If improperly measured, then it can result in gaps and loss of call data. There are equipments, which comes with jitter buffer to smooth out the gaps and reduces call latency.</p>
<h3>Analyzing RTP and RTCP to Search the Issue</h3>
<p>When we deal with the issue of troubleshooting a network, one has to get inside the granular details. In case of VoIP, two factors <a class="zem_slink" title="Real-time Transport Protocol" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Real-Time Transport Protocol</a> (RTP) and <a class="zem_slink" title="RTP Control Protocol" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTP_Control_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Real-Time Transport Control Protocol</a> Packets (RTCP) are important for solving the problems.</p>
<p>RTP is something more than packaging and delivery of voice data. It is also able to troubleshoot issues like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A series of numbers helps to detect lost or out of series packets</li>
<li>The payload type, assigned by the signaling protocol</li>
<li>A sync source identifier that identifies the unique RTP stream</li>
<li>A timestamp sets to figure out the packet arrival rate to the listener and to calculate jitter</li>
</ul>
<p>RTCP packets are useful in because they report on the various details of call progress. RTCP packets generally captured between two VoIP users, to see how many packets drops.</p>
<h3>What Should The VoIP Troubleshooting Tool Contain?</h3>
<p>At Fusion, when we plan to troubleshoot the poor VoIP call quality, we employ a tool that can measure overall metrics like MOS and R-Factor, along with latency, jitter, and packet loss. This device helps to capture the RTP streams, and to get call quality information close to that user.</p>
<p>The use of robust VoIP tools at Fusion, go beyond simply reporting the jitter. They are also able to check the independent sources of jitter directly from the RTP stream. We also receive the notifications by an end-device via RTCP, in real-time via RTP stream analysis. This two-way analysis helps to pinpoint where in the network jitter starts to become a problem.</p>
<p>Fusion thinks about their customer and business client so they stick to the right metrics and right analysis tool to make their calling service effective.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the innovation of new contact center technologies, everyday businesses are opening up new channels of communication. Among all other contact center equipments, Voice-Over-IP (VoIP) is the most interesting and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/call-center-outsourcing-become-more-efficient.html" target="_blank">highly influencing technology</a>. In the recent days, VoIP technology is no more a gimmick. The international <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/voip-improves-call-center-performance.html" target="_blank">call centers prefer VoIP</a> to other equipments available in the market.</p>
<p>Why do we prefer to use VoIP technology at our call centers? Is VoIP the next big business trend of 2013?</p>
<p>Well, business owners have three good reasons to use VoIP at their call centers.</p>
<h3>1) VoIP Lessens the Cost</h3>
<p>If we look at our call center once, we will find that traditional phone services are installed in huge numbers. Those phone services runs on copper wires and are taxed or regulated by the federal, state, and local governments. The governments add surcharges and taxes, as a result of which you have to pay heavy phone bills at the end of the month. When traditional phone service is compared to the internet, it is the internet, which wins. It is free from all kind of pesky fees that adds up over time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.business.att.com/content/whitepaper/forrester_att_voip_tap.pdf" target="_blank">Research</a> done by the Forrester Group, says that around 51% of the contact center companies are adopting VoIP, to offer better solutions to their customers. The research also affirmed that the call centers are able to lower down their transaction and communication cost by 60% to 61% in 2012. Therefore, contact center managers are keeping their hopes high in 2013.</p>
<h3>2) VoIP Enables the Easy Way to Send Fax</h3>
<p><a href="http://compnetworking.about.com/od/voipvoiceoverip/g/fax_over_ip.htm" target="_blank">IP based fax</a> (FoIP) solutions takes about $5 per month. It helps to send and receive fax from the laptops, Smartphone and even the age-old fax machines.</p>
<p>Actually, IP faxing is environment-friendly equipment and reduces the need of paper and printer ink and the fax machine itself. IP faxing is a revolution and helps a business to overcome the hurdles of traditional communication equipments. It helps call center owners to save money every month. At Fusion, we are using VoIP and have boosted our company to gain quick and efficient reputation due to the quick fax response.</p>
<h3>3) Use of VoIP Makes it Easy to Scale</h3>
<p>With a traditional model of communication, it is hard to add and reduce extensions, but with VoIP, it is easy to add extensions. These extensions can be directed to any phone, across the world, allowing employees to do their work from home.</p>
<p>These three benefits illuminate the VoIP monitoring and bring a number of benefits to call centers. Well, VoIP has one major disadvantage, clogging networks and other performance issues can bring down the call quality.</p>
<p>However, you will come across VoIP solutions, which gives you, access to granular view of metrics and shows the performance level on every VoIP call, which is placed. With VoIP monitoring, you are going to stay one-step ahead in the contact center industry. Forrester Group says that 36% of the major companies are considering the implementation of the VoIP as important in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Switch to the new technologies to escalate your call center performance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Call center outsourcing being one of the top business trends for quite some time now, questions are bound to arise whether or not the outsourcing sector underwent any change. The truth is, a lot has changed here and changed for the good. From the outsourcing destinations to the technologies used for serving clients to the scope of functions, change is prominent everywhere and anywhere.</p>
<p>The best part is all these changes have more or less yielded positive results, call center services have become economic and even more efficient. Be it advanced <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/customer-relationship-management-is-required-in-call-centers.html">Customer Relationship Management</a> (CRM) technologies or cost effective outsourcing destinations, present day business enterprises have found a very reliable and most importantly competent business partner in the call center companies.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4677" title="Call Center Outsourcing Become More Efficient" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/technology-call-center.jpg" alt="Call Center Outsourcing Become More Efficient" width="600" height="325" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/technology-call-center.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/technology-call-center-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Let us have a closer look at the changes that have made life easier and economic for contemporary entrepreneurs. For convenience let us discuss the same under three broad headings.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>A) </strong><strong>Innovation and Upgrade in the Field of Technology</strong>:</span></h3>
<p>In these times of constrained budgets and extremely competitive market scenario, the only thing that delights entrepreneurs is the ongoing technological innovations in the corporate customer service hubs. Call center companies and their agents are up on the toes to improve and expand the CRM technologies. At the same time they have in mind the cost considerations. Constant efforts are being made to keep the pricing as affordable as possible.</p>
<p>Now that businesses aim to globalize their operations, the technology at disposal should be adept enough. Such has been the level of development and progress in the realm of call center technology that many, like Jason Compton say that the modern call center agents are even capable of ‘following the sun’. No matter to which part of the world the entrepreneurs want to expand their activities, present day CRM technologies are capable to offer support to customers located in any nook and corner of the globe.</p>
<p>Most call center companies have multiple functional sites spread all over the world. And if noticed, we will see bulks of these new operational sites are located in the lower-cost countries. Such a move is guided by definite reasons. We shall have a look at the same in the next section. As of now let us focus on the changes that the call centers have experienced in the realm of technology. These are the changes that make these external vendors so much more effective and efficient.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VOIP in place of PSTN</strong>: Customer Relationship Management has become better and easier with the introduction of VOIP in place of PSTN that is a switch from circuit-switched telephony to packet-switched telephony. There are many external vendors who chose to stick to the traditional PSTN system, IP telephony have opened up doors for upgrading. What is perhaps the most attractive feature, VOIP is really economic.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Voice Response (IVR)</strong>: <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/system-for-call-centers.html">Interactive Voice Response system</a> permits the call handling executives to automate services. This saves good bit of time and money as well. Now automated answering service machines are used for handling routine inquiries. The agents are free for addressing more complex issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For example</em> &#8211; in case of a <a href="http://www.ordersatellitenow.com/" target="_blank">satellite TV service provider</a>, calls seeking information on account balance can be addressed through IVR. And for any inquiry or information as to how to install a particular device or how a particular feature operates it is better to approach a live agent.</p>
<p>Wondering how the IVR system works? First callers have to dial specific numbers as instructed by the pre recorded voice. Then the well maintained database is accessed to pull in the necessary information and assist the caller. Many IVR systems are blessed with speech recognition technology and a few can actually gather feedback from customers once the interaction is over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration of Live and Automated Answering Service</strong>: No doubt IVR has made life easier for answering service agents but callers still prefer live answering service agents. As a matter of fact there are several issues that can be dealt only and only by live agents. Here in the CTI technology i.e. Computer Technology Integration acts as a bridge between the IVR agents and agent workstations.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For example</em> &#8211; a customer wants to book a flight ticket. Because of system issues the transaction stops mid way. CTI ensures that all the information that the customer have already shared are stored. Here from the agent can take over. This accelerates handling time and saves the customers some frustration; he/she does not need to provide the same information all over again. Above all he/she is being assisted by a live agent now.</p>
<p>Most call center companies use a perfect blending of live answering service and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/answering-service-by-bpo-manila.html">automated answering services</a> to strike a balance between economy and efficiency.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Effective Call Routing facility</strong>: Modern call center technology enables skill based routing. This call routing facility ensures that senior agents handles the complex issues. This definitely has positive impacts all round including customer’s perception of the business. Much to the surprise this facility is hugely underutilized. According to a survey conducted by the Service Quality Management Group only a very limited number of contact centers, as low as one third of the total number of vendors use it. Experts strongly recommend the use of this facility for a better performance.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud based services</strong>: With VOIP all that the call center agents need is an access to the internet. They can get the liberty to work from home. And for the supervisors, they can supervise and monitor from anywhere and everywhere. There is no need of servers on premise, media gateways on the premise, support services can be offered from any corner of the globe. This is exactly the reason why call center industry has shifted its base to the third world countries. But this development we shall discuss later.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new cloud based services are flexible, scalable, secured, transparent, cost effective, easy to implement and above all reliable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration with the web and social media</strong>: As a very attractive part of the new <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/cloud-crm-tips-you-need-to-know.html">cloud based services</a>, call center companies now make use of the web and Social Media as Service (SMAS). This has expanded the horizon and reach of the call center agents. At the end of the day it is the business enterprises driven by profit motives that have benefited from this integration with the web world. Offering customer support, gathering customer feedback and customer outreach have become easier than never before.</li>
</ul>
<p>The host of improved <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/Trends-and-Technology-45155.aspx" target="_blank">technology tools and gadgets</a> will make things easier but for the perfect results Tim Hickernell, senior program director at META Group, advises caution in vendor selection. More technology intensive the services have become more is the need for expert and experienced call center agents.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>B) </strong><strong>Expansion of the Scope of Functions of Call Center Companies</strong><strong>:</strong></span></h3>
<p>In consonance with the technological upgrade, contact center companies have expanded the scope of their functions. An industry that started with assisting the business executives in answering customer calls and taking down messages, have grown and grown substantially. Not only customer handling but also marketing the business products or services have been added to the list of duties and responsibilities. The good thing is, companies have not stopped by merely expanding the scope of functions they have concentrated in specialization as well.</p>
<p>The discussion on the latest CRM software made it pretty evident that customer relationship management is not only about answering customer calls; it holds a broader and wider connotation. The present day answering service agents not only answer calls, they try and build rewarding connections. Customers</p>
<p><strong>Improve the Business Sales Performance: </strong></p>
<p>Healthy business-buyer connection has all the potentials to influence the eventual sales figures in a positive way. Outstanding customer service leaves the customers happy and contented. A satisfied customer base brings in more sales opportunities in the form of repeat sales and sale through referrals. Now this is the main reason why the customer care executives slog so hard to put up a very positive business image or brand identity.</p>
<p>Improving sale figures through customer retention is not the only way how call center companies contribute to the sales performance. These days’ businesses outsource the entire marketing process to be taken care of by the experienced marketing agents at the disposal of these companies. And much to the delight of the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/inbound-call-center-services-in-manila-saves.html">entrepreneurs</a> this move has paid off.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, modern day contact center companies have a role to play in the all round development of the businesses. Right from increasing the productivity to improving the revenue figures to enhancing the overall business value- services offered by call center companies have a bearing in all these areas.</p>
<p><strong>New Areas of Call Center Activities: </strong></p>
<p>Besides serving the conventional industries guided by the profit motive the companies now have ventured into newer areas. The newer and unconventional areas where call centers have <a href="http://www.outsource2india.com/why_india/articles/new_areas.asp" target="_blank">made their presence</a> felt are the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>E- governance services</li>
<li>Retail services</li>
<li>Pharmaceutical research services</li>
<li>Financial services</li>
<li>Healthcare services</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Coordination, monitoring and supervision of different call center activities are no problem: </strong>One of the biggest concerns that entrepreneurs of yesteryears had was how to coordinate the different activities of the call center agents. Monitoring and evaluating their performance was another headache they had. The bone of contention here was, if the services offered by the agents weren’t scrutinized the quality of the service might suffer.</li>
</ul>

As a matter of fact, improved call center technology have made coordination way easier.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geographically scattered agents are more of an advantage than disadvantage: </strong>The new web based call center technology permits customer care executives and even marketers to work from home. Can such geographical dispersion of agents create troubles as far as coordination, monitoring and supervision is concerned? Well no. The same advanced features of the virtual call center technology comes to rescue.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the call recording feature that enables call center quality assurance team as well as the in-house quality control team to record every single incoming and outbound call so that the agents’ performance can be evaluated. Web conferences can be arranged for to train and educate the agents. Similar conferences can be arranged for discussing the problems that the agents are facing or the mistakes they are making.</p>
<p>Now that the technology is capable of establishing link between the widely scattered agents, enterprises can hope to cater to the needs and requirements of their global customer base with utmost efficiency.</p>

Now businesses can cut down on their investment while keeping the return on the same as handsome as ever, an arrangement they were looking for so long.</p>
<p>So we can conclude on a positive note, the call center industry which began journey in the aftermath of globalization has further consolidated its position. Call centers be domestic or offshore are here to stay for a long time and serve the present day enterprises to achieve their stiff targets and goals. The future of these companies seems pretty bright and so does the future of business enterprises.</p>
