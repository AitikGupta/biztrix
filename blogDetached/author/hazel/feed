<p>The success of your debt collection efforts often depends on the effectiveness of your phone work. While following <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/are-there-laws-that-limit-what-debt-collectors-can-say-or-do-en-329/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</a> is an essential part of any debt collection process, the tone, timing, and framing of the conversation of the collection executive can make or break the call.</p>



<p>Having decades of experience in handling debt collection
calls on behalf of our clients, Fusion has in-depth knowledge on how to improve
your debt collection calls.&nbsp; Here we
share a few tips that can help you improve your debt collection efforts: </p>



<h2>Tips for Improving Debt Collection Calls</h2>



<h3><strong>Things to Remember:</strong></h3>



<p>While making <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/collection-services.html">debt collection calls</a> one must follow the letter of the law stating the best practices for A/R recovery. Apart from the legal ramifications, you must also keep in mind debt collection calls are made on behalf of your business and therefore, you should maintain the professional courtesy on the call. Remember, in this age of social media, one step out of the line can make your brand viral for all the wrong reasons. </p>



<p>Therefore, you must stay positive yet in-control of your
debt collection calls. A confident tone will earn you a better response from
your customers and help you meet the needs of your business without damaging
the company-customer relationship. </p>



<p>So how to prepare for success while making debt collection
calls? Here are some tried and tested tips:<strong>
&#8211; </strong></p>



<h3>1.    Be Proactive </h3>



<p>following up after sending the product or providing service
or one or two days prior to the due date may help you avoid non-payment.
Therefore, you must proactively interact with your customers and ask them if
everything was satisfactory and whether they have received the invoice.&nbsp; This will also help you maintain a better
customer-company relationship.</p>



<h3>2.    Be Prepared </h3>



<p>Before making the call gather and have in front of you as
much information about your customer and the debt as you can, including having
the file and all the invoices at hand. Fusion always advocates having all the
data at the agent’s fingertip.&nbsp; It helps
them improve the success rate of their collection calls.</p>



<h3>3.    Get Your Conversation Pointers Ready </h3>



<p>Before making a collection call, you must jot down the
pointers you want to talk about in a call.&nbsp;
This will help you stay in control over the conversation and get back on
track in case the interaction goes off the track. </p>



<h3>4.    Smile During the Call<strong> </strong></h3>



<p>While the customer can’t see your face, smiling can lighten
your tone of voice. This way, you will sound more positive and confident.&nbsp; Fusion has always encouraged its collection
agents to smile on call.&nbsp; It brings a
positive impact on the call.&nbsp; </p>



<h3>5.    Use the Person’s Name</h3>



<p>A person’s name is the sweetest thing to his ears and
addressing by their name adds the personal touch to the call creating a better
customer experience.&nbsp; However, overdoing
it will make the customer feel irritated.</p>



<h3>6.    Speak Confidently and Concisely</h3>



<p>Conveying a concise message in a confident tone can help you get a better response from your customers. However, you must never get emotional on collection calls or you will lose the control and the other party will take advantage of it.  If you feel emotional, you should wait for a while before answering. </p>



<p>Sure, it is difficult to keep emotions at bay especially while dealing with tricky customers. But a tricky customer can use your emotion against you. For this reason, it is always better to outsource your debt collection service to an experienced debt collection agency.  </p>



<h3>7.    Listen Carefully but also use Silence to Control the Conversation</h3>



<p>You need to be a good listener on a debt collection call.
Once you deliver your message in a concise way, you should listen to what the
other party has to say in this matter.&nbsp;
However, do not let the other party take control of the call. You can
use silence to take control back as and when necessary.</p>



<h3>8.    Stay Calm, Even if the Customer Gets Upset</h3>



<p>Not all collection calls go smoothly. During some calls,
emotions run high and the customer gets upset.&nbsp;
However, you must stay calm in such situations.&nbsp; If you too get emotional, the purpose of the
call will be ruined and you will have to start afresh. </p>



<h3>9.    Take Notes </h3>



<p>Documenting everything that is said, including the
customer&#8217;s feedback, can help you in case of any dispute. </p>



<h3>10.    Don&#8217;t Jump to Conclusions<strong> </strong></h3>



<p>The initial collection call should aim to confirm that the
debt has not been paid. This will ensure you are not alienating an otherwise
good customer. The unpaid invoice may be a miscommunication, and not a
collection issue at all, so you want to be careful. During our vast experience
in providing debt collection services, we have seen that a mistake from the
accounts department can lead to such problems. </p>



<h3><strong>11</strong>.    Give Options</h3>



<p>Suggesting options like paying in installments can help the
debtor clear their dues faster. If the person you are calling agrees to pay by
credit card, you must ensure that he/she signs the statement. You can fax them
the authorization form and have them fax it back after signing. Do not leave
anything to chances.</p>



<h3>12.    Get a Commitment</h3>



<p>Without a commitment from a customer to pay, the call is
potentially wasted. Whether it’s a partial or full payment, or a commitment to
pay at a certain date is essential for a successful collection call.</p>



<h3>13.    Conclude Well</h3>



<p>Before ending the call, you must convey the summary of the
entire call to the debtor party, including how and when they will make the payment
and depending on the mode of payment ask the debtor to confirm when the payment
has been made.</p>



<h3>14.    Keep in Interaction Open</h3>



<p>Someone who may not be able to pay up may be able to pay
later, so keep the conversation open. You can also help them figure out how to
get the money without paying big interest. This way you can carry on your
negotiation and still can maintain a good relationship with your customer. </p>



<p>These are some of the tips that can help you make professional quality debt recovery calls. Having problems handling collection calls on your own? Fusion can help. We are a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/collection-services.html">licensed debt collection services provider</a> who has decades of experience in providing debt recovery services to numerous clients.</p>

<p>Customers today are exposed to the gold standard of customer service and hence expect nothing but the best experience from a business. Therefore, providing <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/services.html">outstanding customer service</a> round the clock in a call center environment has become a must for every business. It helps you stay ahead of your competition, retain your customers, and even win over new customers. But there’s a secret ingredient in this recipe for success that distinguishes the greats from the ordinary. And that is – personalized customer service. </p>



<p>&nbsp;By personalizing
customer service, you start treating people as people and not as just a
customer. A little personalization can go a long way empowering your customers
and lead to customer loyalty, confident agents, higher sales, and better
competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Wondering how to add personalization to your call center
customer service? Here are a few tips:</p>



<h3>1. Use Automation</h3>



<p><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/will-ai-replace-or-enhance-a-call-center.html">Automation can be a great tool to personalize customer service</a>. Automation can help your agents save time to provide one-on-one care to customers who need that. Automation or AI can be used to:</p>



<ul><li>route customers to the right department
intelligently</li><li>collect necessary data before starting a voice
interaction</li><li>Share real-time information between agents or
teams</li></ul>



<p>Chatbots, CRM integrations, scripts, and other automation
tools can help make the lives of customer service agents a lot easier.</p>



<h3>2. Create full customer profiles</h3>



<p>Creating profiles of your customer groups will help you understand your customers better. You will be able to see their motivations in a customer service environment and make informed decisions. You will be able to take a look at your customer data from the marketing team to understand your customer demographic and develop accurate profiles with personalized information.</p>



<p>These profiles will help you offer more personalized service to your customers. And the personalized the care, the greater is the chance of customer satisfaction.</p>



<h3>3. Use optimized scripts</h3>



<p>At first glance, script and personalized customer service do
not seem to gel well. But scripts can truly be the key to delivering a
high-quality personalized customer experience. Using a call center scripting
software, you can now customize and deploy script. While features like CRM
integration and others help your agents and customers get what they need in one
place.&nbsp; </p>



<p>An integrated call script can help agents big time. They can simply follow a guided session that links to their preferred CRM and deliver personalized customer service. They can provide feedback on the efficacy of a particular script and can even improve on that.</p>



<p>This way, you can get a tested, observed and approved a script that can satisfy your customer, increase the efficiency of your agents, drive brand loyalty and positive conversion. That is the reason Fusion believes, a high performing script is a key to success.</p>



<h3>4. Offer Multichannel and Self-service support options</h3>



<p>Personalized customer service is all about empowering your
customers and valuing their choices. Not every customer is comfortable with the
same communication channels and therefore you should provide them solutions
through the communication channel of their choice.</p>



<p>Offering <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-omnichannel-customer-service-best-practices-to-boost-customer-experience.html">multichannel service</a> for finding solutions, answering queries, troubleshooting, and contacting the right team sends your customer the message that you are rooting for them. Offering self-service is personalization at its best. Here are a few communication channels that you can provide service through:&nbsp; </p>



<ul><li>phone</li><li><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/looking-to-improve-email-customer-support-heres-how-we-do-it.html">email </a></li><li><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/how-to-provide-good-live-chat-support-to-your-customers.html">live chat</a></li><li><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/12-tips-for-enhanced-customer-service-through-social-media.html">social media</a></li><li>self-service support options</li></ul>



<p>With consumers preferring self-service support, you should
start offering a personalized self-service option that helps customers quickly
and easily find the answer they need. It makes the customers happy and takes
the stress away from your call center and sales team.</p>



<h3>5. Be a Human</h3>



<p>&nbsp;In order to win your
customers being a human is as important as personalization.&nbsp; Your customers should never feel like they
are talking to robots, even if they initially interacted with one.&nbsp; Personalized customer service training must
involve ways of responding like a human, dealing with emotions, and working
through different customer scenarios. Training your agents to deal with all
these will go a long way in creating a personalized and productive customer
experience. </p>



<p>While providing your customers with a seamless personalized
service experience involves many factors, it is not very difficult to achieve.
You just have to know your customers and meet their needs with different
customer support tools and automation. </p>
