								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Businesses everywhere face a major issue today – outstanding consumer debt. To fix the issue one needs to deal with each consumer carefully, have patience and keep the parties reminding about their debt. However, the real problem arises when these debts reach the point of delinquency.</p>
<p>In such cases, third-party debt collection agencies, as well as in-house collection teams, can offer a business a chance to recover those debts. However, third-party debt collection agencies offer a diverse range of advantages to suit the needs of a modern growing business. According to <a href="https://www.acainternational.org/assets/research-statistics/aca-wp-role3rdparty.pdf">a study by ACA International</a>, in 2013, third-party collection companies returned $44.9 billion to creditors. The distinctive nature of third-party debt collection makes it easier to recover debts that were otherwise deemed irrecoverable.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6308" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Debt-Returned.png" alt="Debt Returned by Third-party Debt Collection Agencies in the U.S. in 2013" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Debt-Returned.png 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Debt-Returned-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Third-party debt collection agencies offer a diverse range of advantages. Let us take a look at some-</p>
<h3>1. Cost-effective</h3>
<p>The overhead of staffing and running costs would be greatly reduced upon retaining an <a href="http://vitalsolutions.net/recovery/">efficient third-party collection agency</a>. To maintain an in-house collection, some businesses spend big money on staffing, telephone calls, invoicing, visits to the debtor&#8217;s office etc. Third-party agencies do not require such investment.</p>
<h3>2. Freedom to focus on core business operations</h3>
<p>The success and growth of a business depend on the successful recovery of its outstanding debts. The task of debt recovery may keep a business from focusing on their core operation. Therefore, retaining a third party collection agency would give the business the freedom to focus on core business operations.</p>
<h3>3. Debtors take third-party debt collection agencies more seriously</h3>
<p>Since the business relationship between the creditor and the debtor remains quite close, it may be difficult for in-house collection to be effective. Experience has shown that the debtor would most likely take a third party debt collection agency more seriously than an in-house collection.</p>
<h3>4. Third-party collection agencies use modern and effective recovery techniques</h3>
<p>The harsh economic climate in a majority of jurisdictions has made it trickier to recover debts.  In such situation, orthodox methods that fail to yield positive results. The modern and proven recovery strategies of a third party collection agency enable businesses to recover outstanding debts promptly.</p>
<h3>5. Third-party collection agency more efficient in international scene</h3>
<p>With the increase in international trade and investment, the risk and cost of going across borders to recover the debt may be more than the debt itself. In such case, in-house debt recovery might not be able to recover the amount.  In such a case, retaining the services of a debt recovery agency within the jurisdiction of the debtor will help the business recover the debt.</p>
<h3>6. Third-party agency can offer expert help</h3>
<p>Also, the process of recovery of some debts may be technical. Hiring a debt recovery expert skilled in the technical process of debt recovery can promptly solve this problem without having to deal with training your in-house debt collection stuff.</p>
<h3>7. Improved chance of debt recovery</h3>
<p>In many cases, third-party collection agencies are paid a contingency fee upon recovery of debts. Since third-party collection agencies only get paid when the debts are recovered, they have a higher motivation to be efficient and record higher collection rates. Thus, a business has a higher chance of recovering their money by hiring a third-party debt collection agency.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every business faces the issue with accounts receivable every once in a while irrespective their size.  And yet, most of them feel as though it will affect the customer relationship negatively if they ask for or demand payment from the customer for the products/services provided.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this popular belief is not at all true.</p>
<p>Your customers will not get disappointed or leave your company just because you asked for payment for products/services provided. They know that they owe you. If your customers are leaving you, it’s not because you’re asking them to pay their bills, but it may have something to do with the way you go about collecting invoices.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, better accounts receivable management can considerably improve customer satisfaction and retention.</p>
<p>By implementing <a href="http://www.ofm.wa.gov/resources/misc/Receivable_Collection_Best_Practices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">debt collection best practices</a>, you can not only provide better customer service and increase customer satisfaction, but also you can increase your cash flow and grow your business.</p>
<p>Even if you have a few difficult customers who don’t want to pay, a majority of your customers truly do want to pay outstanding account receivable.  However, sometimes things do not go as planned and they fail to pay you on time.</p>
<h3>Why do you want to improve account receivable management?</h3>
<p>After all the time, effort and money it took to turn a prospect into a customer, you would not want to lose them over an unpaid invoice, right? You and your team have already given so much effort to retain these customers. Blowing the chance of repeat purchases because of a frustrating collection experience is not a wise decision. Also it takes a huge cost to acquiring a new customer.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is better to improve the collection experience by managing accounts receivable better and keep the existing customers happier.</p>
<h3>How can improved accounts receivable management make customers happier?</h3>
<p>It’s quite simple actually! <a href="http://www.vitalsolutions.net/" target="_blank">Good accounts receivable management</a> will make their lives much easier, help them remember to send in their checks, and make the process easy.</p>
<p>Here are a few simple things you can begin with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a plan. The Credit Research Foundation estimates that <a href="http://e2banytime.com/docs/White_Paper_-_How_To_Develop_A_Business_Credit_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">only 20% of credit departments have formalized policies with well-defined goals</a>.</li>
<li>Centralize all data and information</li>
<li>Provide agents with timely and accurate information to avoid any misunderstanding</li>
<li>Define roles. It is important to know who has which responsibility</li>
<li>Determine KPIs to see how your business is doing in overall collection scenario.</li>
<li>Manage your resources</li>
<li>Define dispute resolution procedure</li>
<li>Focus on important accounts</li>
<li>Be proactive and invoice the parties earlier to let them know it is time for them to pay their dues</li>
<li>Make sure invoices are complete and correct</li>
<li>Include your terms clearly on invoice</li>
<li>Have a standard system for follow-up (letters, emails, phone calls, etc.)</li>
<li>Escalate troubled accounts</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, if you have a small AR department or do not have the right tools for the job, you will find AR management a little difficult. After all, software and communication templates may save the situation but they will never be able to replace a personalized communication. In such case, to deal with accounts receivable, you might have to hire debt collection agencies that can deal with the situation expertly and make your customers happier.</p>
<p>Remember, accounts receivable is your last communication with the customer on a sale, and it can have a huge impact on whether or not they choose to do business with you again.</p>
