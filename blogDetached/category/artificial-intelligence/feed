<p>With self-service on the rise, many people believe that the
time is up for live human agents who have been the backbone of call center and
customer service industry. Fusion respectfully begs to differ. </p>



<p>Having more than 15 years of experience in the call center
industry, we have studied consumer behavior closely. And while customer support
has changed a lot over the years thanks to technological advancements like
self-service and AI, live agents still remain the most preferred choice for
customer support, especially in the complex cases. </p>



<p>Here are a few of our observations on the role of live
agents in the modern customer service industry:</p>



<h3>1. People Still Want To Interact With A Human Agent</h3>



<p>Customer service encounters through social media or self-service don’t always leave customers feeling great confidence. On the other hand, interacting with a fellow human can make your customers feel reassured. </p>



<p>Even the tech-savvy <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/provide-quality-customer-service-to-the-millennials.html">millennials</a> who prefer self-service and other technology-rich customer service channels, resort to interacting with live customer service agents via voice or <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">chat</a> when they face a complex issue.  </p>



<p>Therefore, live agents are still very much relevant in the modern customer service scene and if anything, they play a far more significant role today than the role it used to play earlier.</p>



<h3>2. Customers Want Easy Access To Live Agents</h3>



<p>No matter how technologically advanced a call center becomes, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/engage-your-agents-xfactor-quality-customer-experience.html">there is no alternative of human agents</a>.  Even today, customers are more comfortable to convey their unique issues to a human agent than to a chatbot or IVR. Therefore, customers must be given the choice to talk to a live human agent and the option should be clearly conveyed to the customer. Many businesses these days think so as well.</p>



<p>In the Customer Contact Week Digital market study, <a href="https://www.customercontactweekdigital.com/content-auto-download/5be9b822d1d92e406f3b64d1">64%</a> of respondents agreed that customers must have easy access to a live human agent.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY.jpg" alt="THE FUTURE OF THE CONTACT CENTER IN 2019" class="wp-image-6593" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY.jpg 801w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-300x285.jpg 300w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-768x729.jpg 768w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-750x712.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></figure>



<p>As a call center with over 15 years of experience, Fusion has also seen that a customer is far more comfortable in discussing their issues with a human agent than telling it all to a faceless machine entity. They crave for the empathy that only a live human agent can deliver.</p>



<h3>3. Live Agents Can Handle Complex Issues Better</h3>



<p>All the issues handled by customer service can predominantly
be classified into two groups –</p>



<ul><li>Simple issues or inquiries </li><li>Complex problems</li></ul>



<p>Simple issues can be defined as issues that can be handled
within a single interaction or a basic issue reporting that can be resolved by
the company without additional customer input. These issues generally are
frequent and reoccurring and therefore, addressing them with automated channels
like knowledge-based systems, social media, improved website forms, text
messages, and chat systems makes complete sense. </p>



<p>However, when the problem is complex, automated channels fail to effectively resolve them. For this reason, most complex issues are handled over the phone.</p>



<p>It takes more time to explain the problem in detail so that the customer service agent can understand it, analyze it, and work on providing the resolution. However, the process can be improved by integrating AI with human agents.</p>



<h3>4. Artificial Intelligence Should Complement Human Agents Instead Of Replacing Them</h3>



<p>While <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Artificial Intelligence (opens in a new tab)">Artificial Intelligence</a> or AI is the buzzword in modern customer support, it is still not in a position where it can replace a human agent. AI is to go a long way before it can master the art of natural language processing (NLP) and empathy. Instead, it can be used to aid a live agent and make their job easier.  </p>



<p>For example – if one of your customers has an issue
regarding their bills, a live agent will take some time to find relevant
information. &nbsp;When AI is brought into the
scene, it will be able to show the agent the past interaction history on the
screen along with itemized billing so that it becomes easier for the agent to
promptly resolve the issue and ask about the previous issue the customer
faced.&nbsp; It will up the customer
satisfaction level.&nbsp; </p>



<h4>Conclusion: </h4>



<p>Human agents were, are, and will be occupying the central position of the customer service industry.  The chance of AI replacing live agents looks very slim in the near future as AI needs a lot of improvement to be at par with a human agent in terms of emotional intelligence. </p>

<p>Chatbots have been on the rise since a couple of years and
have already gained popularity. Chatbots can help businesses interact with
their customers and prospects in a new way using messaging apps, the latest
technology, and Artificial Intelligence. </p>



<h2>What is a Chatbot?</h2>



<p>A chatbot is a service that can interact with you just like a real person. Powered by rules and  Artificial Intelligence, chatbots are programmed to simulate a real conversation with users through a chat interface. They are based on machine learning to imitate human conversation and react to service requests.</p>



<p>AI helps them learn the language, human tone, and behavior with every interaction, which in turn helps them to be more intelligent and serve the users better. </p>



<p>For a better understanding of how chatbots can contribute to
your business, let us find the top 7 benefits of chatbots:</p>



<h2>1. Being Present on Messaging Platforms</h2>



<p>Today messaging applications have more users than social
media network. And as customers today think that chat is a convenient and
faster way to interact with a business, businesses today have the chance to
reach more audience via chatbots while staying trendy.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The Majority of smartphone users today do not want to
download new apps. So, businesses can integrate their chatbot in one of the
popular platforms that the customers use on a daily basis such as &#8211; Facebook,
Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. It will also save you time and money. </p>



<h2>2. Improved Customer Service</h2>



<h4>A. Extensive Customer Assistance</h4>



<p>According to a <a href="https://econsultancy.com/83-of-online-shoppers-need-support-to-complete-a-purchase-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">survey</a>, 83% of online shoppers want assistance during shopping. So, your customers may need assistance at any time. Additionally, shoppers may also face navigation issues, or have queries about registration, payment, checkout, and delivery or about the product itself.</p>



<p>In such situations, chatbots can provide real-time assistance through interactive communication over text and voice. They can also provide customers with important relevant information from knowledge base, blogs, tutorial videos and so on.</p>



<h4>B. Always-Available Customer Support</h4>



<p>A great 24/7 customer service has a positive impact on customer satisfaction. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">Chatbots can help you improve the customer support</a> process by quickly giving automated answers to repetitive questions immediately and forwarding the complex ones to a human agent.</p>



<p>Apart from that, chatbots allow businesses to attend more queries at the same time, allowing companies to scale up their operation to new markets globally.</p>



<h4>C. Proactive Customer Interaction</h4>



<p>Companies can also use chatbots to start <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/proactive-customer-service-and-how-to-start-practicing-it.html">proactive customer interactions</a> regarding any issue, any time of the day. This will make your customers feel that your brand cares for them on a 24/7 basis. This can help improve your brand perception in the long run.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chatbot-example.jpg" alt="AI-Based Chatbot Example" class="wp-image-6579" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chatbot-example.jpg 720w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chatbot-example-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<h2>3. Increased Customer Engagement</h2>



<p>Chatbots can be a great tool for customer engagement.
Chatbots can provide the customers with a specific slice of information and
lead the interaction based on the user input at that time.&nbsp; This way, chatbots never provides a dull
interaction with irrelevant and useless information resulting in better
engagement. </p>



<h2>4. Monitoring Consumer Data and Gaining Insights</h2>



<p>Businesses can make changes in their service/products based on the feedback chatbots collect through simple questions. As chatbots are also capable of tracking purchasing patterns and consumer behavior by monitoring user data, they can also help a company to decide marketing strategies.</p>



<p>Companies can use chatbots to track consumer request and responses, predict responses based on the language and direct the chatbot to suggest an alternative product or service. </p>



<h2>5. Cost Savings</h2>



<p>Implementing a full functioning chatbot is cheaper and faster than creating a cross-platform app or hiring chat support agents for each task. Businesses today can <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="choose from ready-made applications (opens in a new tab)">choose from ready-made applications</a> developed by Facebook, Microsoft, and other IT giants.</p>



<p>Being automated solutions, chatbots can handle many customers at once, saving employee costs and eliminating the scope for human errors. Finally, as customers can access chatbots easily within seconds and interact immediately, the cost of user acquisition also comes down.</p>



<p>These are some of the major benefits chatbots bring to your business. with technological advancements, chatbots will become smarter, better and more effective. As chatbot gradually gain maturity, this is the right time to adopt this new technology and give your business an edge.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While voice remains the number one channel for interaction
between business and its customers, the new age customers today are more
inclined to solve the basic customer service issues by themselves.&nbsp; And for that reason, businesses today are
adding self-service to their customer service channels. Self-service can not
only help customers to save time but also can help businesses boost customer
experience and drive customer loyalty. </p>



<p>These are five types of customer self-service a business can
introduce to boost your customer experience.</p>



<h3>1. Customer Self-service Portals</h3>



<p>If you have customers around the clock, you must have a team
of customer service representatives who can give support 24/7 support around
the world. If you do not have such facility and operate limited hours, a large
section of your customers will have a hard time reaching you. Also, the younger
tech-savvy crowd will definitely look for their answers online even before
reaching your customer service.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Rather than leaving your customer without support from your end, you can invest in a customer self-service portal that contains answers to the most common queries, instruction for basic fixes and a few others that a customer can easily resolve.</p>



<p>Using this portal, a customer can get answers to their basic queries and explore the knowledge base for further details during the non-operational hours. This also allows them to bypass the calling queue and get their answer from your end at their own time and pace. </p>



<p>An additional perk?&nbsp;
The self-service portal can significantly decrease your customer service
costs!</p>



<h3>2. Mobile</h3>



<p>Today most people browse the internet from their smartphone.
Scratch that, people today do almost everything on their smartphone – it’s
easy, it’s convenient and a powerful tool that fits in your pocket.</p>



<p>A mobile app or mobile version of your site can prove to be
beneficial as a self-service tool. However, make sure to make the mobile
version of site user-friendly so that your customers can easily navigate
through the site to find the answers they are looking for.</p>



<p>You can also build a user-friendly app that offers push
notifications and updated features that help you keep the customers updated
about the company and its service updates.</p>



<h3>3. Chatbots and AI</h3>



<p>Live chatbots can offer a great customer experience. With
the help of AI, chatbots can answer customer queries in a matter of seconds.
chatbots can help customers by answering their queries, assisting them, and
even helping them with booking and sales. With live chatbots, finding answers to
your queries have become easier than ever. </p>



<p>Live chatbots are a great way to help confused customers.
Many company sites offer a popup chat window that appears after a certain
period of time spent on the website. These bots have the capability to guide
the customer to the answers they are looking for. Even when they do not have
answers, they can point the customers in the right direction. These chatbots
are also a great way to show that your company cares for its customers and CX.</p>



<h3>4. Kiosks</h3>



<p>A kiosk can be good for short, specific tasks, such as
finding an item in a physical store or checking the price. Self-checkout kiosks
can also help a customer with checkout and payment.</p>



<h3>5. Functional Automated Phone Systems</h3>



<p>While the phone remains the preferred business interaction
channel for a large section of customers, the younger generation sees it as the
last resort. You can find a middle ground and offer them the option to speak to
a representative or resolve the issue following an automated menu system and accomplish
the task quickly without needing an agent. </p>



<p>These five types of self-service can help your customers to
quickly find the answer to their queries without needing an agent and boost
their customer experience as well.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this age of technology, we move towards a day when all our problems can be resolved at the press of a button. However, such a day of instant quality solutions to the difficult problem is still a distant dream. However, some think that the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) will change the whole call center scenario and replace the human agents for a faster, quicker and richer customer experience.</p>
<p>We are already seeing AI at work at some of the biggest brands. IVR and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-chatbots-reshaping-customer-service-kishore-saraogi/">chatbots have already become very popular</a> as a customer service solution. But they cannot offer a solution to all the issues a customer might face. And as of now AI also lacks the human touch that most customers want.</p>
<p>Therefore, even when many see AI as a saving grace that replaces human agent but keeps the human touch, the reality is far from it. While most AI systems (IVR, Live chat system etc.) can resolve the basic queries, they do not have the machine learning capabilities to offer solutions to complex problems. Sure, the data shows that AI has been extremely helpful at times, but to call it a savior would be an exaggeration. You can call AI a performance enhancer for the contact center, not a replacement.</p>
<p>Here are five reasons why AI will not replace a call center in near future:</p>
<h2>1) AI is extremely expensive to fully implement</h2>
<p>As the popularity of AI in customer service increases, many small and medium businesses start worrying about how much money they have to spend to meet the customers’ need for a faster solution that only AI can offer. While you want good CSAT scores by meeting customer expectations and providing them with good customer experience, you should also ask yourself whether it is worth shelling thousands of dollars on an AI system just to meet customer expectations.</p>
<p>Knowing your customer base is the key here. While a business with a younger customer base may want to choose AI over call center as young customers want a prompt solution to their problems, businesses with older customer base would do well by sticking to contact centers. According to SoftwareAdvice, <a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/industryview/big-data-report-2015/" rel="nofollow">63%</a> of people over the age of 35 prefer human interaction in the form of a phone call compared to an automated live chat.</p>
<h2>2) Contact Center AI technology is not up to the mark &#8211; yet</h2>
<p>Properly setting up the systems that require AI and the automation that encompasses it takes a vast amount of resources including money. And yet, today most AI systems do not have machine learning capabilities that help a customer find the exact solution they are looking for. Today AI is in a place where it is nothing more than a system that pulls from a database. If the customer query fetches the wrong result, then the customer has to go back and put a new set of keywords. The machine and AI today does not have a self-taught system that is smart enough to correct itself.</p>
<h2>3) AI can streamline your lower level inquiries</h2>
<p>People still prefer human agents over automation in sales and customer support. But <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-replace-human-agents-call-centers-future-kishore-saraogi/">AI can make the lives easier for customer support agents</a>. You can set up an online FAQ form or get a system with IVR capabilities to streamline the regular queries and basic solutions. It will ensure that the customers call your contact center only when it is necessary and urgent.</p>
<h2>4) Technology today requires sophisticated answers</h2>
<p>The problems or pre-smart gadgets era were far less complex than the issues of today. As the technology advances, its issues grow more complex, and their solutions, therefore, have to be more sophisticated. And only a real live human agent can provide you with the solution as of now.</p>
<p>There is no way you can tackle the vast possibilities of customer queries through FAQ page, IVR or chat. The complex the problems, the more you need a human to resolve it.</p>
<h2>5) AI is a complement to contact center operations</h2>
<p>Today most contact center solutions offer a number of automation features that SMBs want to achieve through AI including &#8211; IVR and advance scripting. These features can definitely improve your contact center operations. But it is not yet in a position to replace it.</p>
<p>AI is still not in a position where it can replace a contact center. While it can definitely act as a performance enhancer and complement your call center operations, it still requires a lot of time and resources to implement. In addition to that, AI is not in a position to resolve complex queries – that power still remains with the human contact center agents. So, it can be said, AI has miles to go before it can become a successor of the contact center, if at all.</p>
