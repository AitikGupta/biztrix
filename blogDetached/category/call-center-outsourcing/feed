								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Possible features you see in a project during pre-launch:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The provider’s sales team has gone away</i></li>
<li><i>All the site visits have been conducted</i></li>
<li><i>The contract has been fastened</i></li>
</ul>
<p>After having a smooth transition, now it is your time to put the offshore delivery and support to test how they can meet all your business demands. In this new outsourcing environment, <i>how will you know that the objective of your business is achieved? Has your service provider managed the goals successfully?</i></p>
<p>When it comes to outsourcing, two things are most prominent &#8211; <i>people and their skills</i>. The delivery teams are given incentives to control the cost of the people. With the use of certain basic rules, these rules help to examine whether the objectives of the offshore team will align with your business goals or not.</p>
<p>Here are some of the criteria that bring success with the help of an offshore delivery team and their management. We adhere to these metrics at Fusion to allow our clients to have a better share of profits.</p>
<h3>ROI (Return on Investment)</h3>
<p>It is not just the sales and the account team who are given the objective to achieve the big ROI &#8211;  this is also a responsibility of the delivery team. You have large goals to achieve. Efficiency and lower cost are the objectives that your offshore partner has to achieve for you. At Fusion, we look into the cost and quality of our service so that clients get better solutions.</p>
<h3>Gross Limits</h3>
<p>This is the second objective that has an impact on the team behavior and controls the resourcing decisions for platforms like &#8211; onshore vs. offshore, dedicated vs. uncommitted, in scope vs. out of scope. It comes to play when you have limited contractual opportunities, and the additional revenue will be billed.</p>
<h3>ROI Earned Per Hour Worked</h3>
<p>ROI earned per hour of work is such a metric that is put to use by the outsourcing channels to control the scope given to their team. So, that they can deploy shadow resources in business process or draw the basic support from the various Centers of Excellence. Unless the contact center is contractually bound to maintain a percentage of shadow resources.</p>
<p>The contact center team is given incentives just to get the minimum need to make sure that they do not lose billing through unexpected expenses.</p>
<h3>Utilization on the Bills</h3>
<p>This is related to ROI generated per hour of work, and maintain the proactive nature of the delivery team during  &#8211; hiring, training, having a bunch of resources which can be later put to use to fight back issues of attrition or to have an expansion. Fusion makes the effective use of the bills to meet your goals and provide the service at an affordable rate.</p>
<h3>Cost Per Hour</h3>
<p>It is calculated on behalf of the entire contact center team who is involved in the process. If it is lower, it becomes easier for the team to achieve their goals.</p>
<h3>Number and Type of Team Members</h3>
<p>It is obvious that the delivery teams must have a specified number of members. These metrics run contrary to the pre-outsourcing. Previously, people with many years of experience carried out the transaction and now they are replaced by the resources. At Fusion, we avoid the conflicting client objectives and maintain a smooth transition by standardizing the process to minimize the need for the experts.</p>
<h3>Satisfying the Clients</h3>
<p>One of the main objectives on which Fusion focuses a lot. Yes, we are talking about “<em>client satisfaction</em>”. This objective is in the perfect accord with clients&#8217; goals. It is something like the tightrope, on which our delivery teams balance themselves. We have automated systems to gather reports on client satisfaction data. This forms the key element to ensure growth of the business and a way to demonstrate the specific vertical.</p>
<p>If your business has made a shift from the pre-outsourcing to an offshore environment, then you have to recognize the ways to have suitable changes that actually takes place behind the scenes but managing the relationship is due to the outcomes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Cut corners” and “increase the bottom line” are the two essential needs for every entrepreneur. To fulfill their goals at the minimum cost, business owners always keep searching for opportunities. Anxiety and stress are the common aspect that strikes every businessperson.</p>
<p>Outsourcing is the answer to entrepreneurs to bring down the cost without sacrificing much in executing related business process. However, this may be the reason why businesspersons become anxious as some of the processes will no longer be handled in-house.</p>
<p>Take a close look on the 5 ways to keep down the anxiety and enjoy all the benefits of outsourcing.</p>
<h3>1) Classify the Scope of Work</h3>
<p>When you engage with the outsourcing companies, it pays to have a scope of work. That is a statement or list of things that you want to be done. Before you think to head towards any kind of endeavor, outsourcing companies have their rules of engagement laid out to avoid finger pointing when a problem crops up.</p>
<p>Inform the outsourcing provider about your upfront requirements. Set the realistic expectations and put up metrics in place, which the outsourcing partner needs to hit.</p>
<h3>2) Do Not Choose On The Basis Of Price</h3>
<p>It is quite tempting, but to choose outsourcing services based on price is a big anxiety generator. You should not consider the price as the sole concern in picking a service provider. In order to buy the services of an outsourcing company, choose them on the basis of a wide variety of spectrums. You should try to maintain the balance between value and quality.</p>
<p>Price is the worst thing to consider, when you opt for a BPO company. Think of ways by which your outsourcing partner can cut costs and make the contract feasible.</p>
<h3>3) Check The Experience Of The Outsourcing Partner</h3>
<p>Look for an outsourcing provider with an excellent background on the business process in which you deal. Choose the partner who will generate quality outputs for you. At Fusion, we give our clients the scope to get more experience on their business space.</p>
<p>Check the track record of the outsourcing partner. Like, if you have a financial organization, then you might like to outsource the payroll. Check out how long the outsourcing partner has been with the payroll engaging system. Do make queries on the positive and negative feedback that other clients have to say on the chosen contractor.</p>
<h3>4) Assess Outsourcing Provider As A Regular Employee</h3>
<p>When you assess or evaluate an outsourcing provider, ask them questions just like you ask an organic employee. Choosing an outsourcing company is always subjective but that does not mean that you will stop yourself being objective.  Rather, ask for references and the performance of the service provider on their own accounts.</p>
<h3>5) Start Small</h3>
<p>Start small when you outsource your business to the leading BPO service providers. This will help you to pull back, when things do not run well. You will be saved from a lot of anxiety. You will also get an idea on how your provider performs before you can think of possible expansion.</p>
<p>Go ahead with the leading BPO companies like Fusion to engage yourself with the benefits of outsourcing and stay away from the anxiety.</p>

To be truer, the Indian and the Philippines call centers were besieged by the Obama government’s decision to restrict outsourcing of business processes to the offshore lands half way across the globes.<br />
But the US based business houses didn’t take much time to realize that such a government decision can have grave implications on the businesses as well as on the overall US economy. The rationale behind such a decision was to stop the migration of the job opportunities from the US to the less developed nations of the Asian continent.<br />
Although the government’s decision to evade taxes to give a boost to the development of the domestic call center businesses also did not help much. The argument was such that the US call center companies can never be as economic as the offshore call center service providers. This is because of the labor charges in these two parts of the world are beyond comparison. The less employment opportunities and the resultant abundance of labor supply has reduced the labor rates in the third world nations to such an extent that the weekly labor charges of the US agents are often higher than the monthly charges of the Indian or the Filipino agents. The good point is that the cost of labor does not have any negative impact whatsoever on the productivity.<br />
Now that recession has lost its old sting, outsourcing to the far away lands have become a lucrative (that it was always) and popular business strategy all over again.</p>
