								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The hospitality industry has performed very well in the past
few years and it is expected to have robust growth in this financial period as
well.&nbsp; Thanks to increasing income levels
in emerging markets and the current global economy, the hospitality industry
has come across a sea of opportunities. As corporate travels, adventure
holidays, and leisure trips increases, the hospitality industry must also gear
up to meet the ever-increasing expectations of their customers. </p>



<p>To present the customers with a wonderful experience, the
hospitality industry must put more emphasis on customer service. As customers
today are exposed to the gold standard of customer service, they can no longer
be sated with good food and a comfortable bed. They want much more – they expect
a hospitality business to provide them with a seamless experience in everything
from interactions to services. </p>



<p>For this reason, more and more hospitality businesses are
trying hard to provide excellent customer service to make their customers happy
about their overall experience. That is not, however, an easy task to do,
especially in the wake of the ever-changing demands of customers today. In
fact, it can turn into a time-consuming, costly affair that can shift the
business’s focus from its core operations and ruin the entire experience for a
customer.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Instead, a hospitality business can outsource some of its non-core operations to a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/travel-transportation-hospitality.html">BPO with experience of serving hospitality businesses</a> in the past.&nbsp; Numerous hospitality industry leaders have successfully outsourced some of their non-core operations to improve the quality of customer experience.&nbsp; Here are a number of services hospitality businesses from across the globe are outsourcing to a BPO without compromising on their customer experience. </p>



<h3>Multilingual Call Center Services</h3>



<p>Today most hotels have an international clientele and in order to make things easy for them a standard hotel can team up with a multilingual call center.&nbsp; This way, when a prospect or customer makes some inquiries regarding booking from another part of the world, a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html">multilingual customer service team</a> can answer them in the customer’s own language on a 24/7 basis. When a hotel provides convenient communication channels with ready assistance to any nationality, it creates a positive impression in the eyes of foreign guests.</p>



<h3>Booking and Reservation Services</h3>



<p>BPOs can help a hotel or restaurant manage their booking and
reservation duties.&nbsp; Equipped with
multi-channel capabilities, call centers can support customer queries, booking
and reservations across a number of channels, such as – voice call, chat,
email, and through an online portal. Most customers today expect quick answers
regarding room availability and reservations, as well as service/facility rates
from the business website or customer service department. And providing them
the answers pronto often deemed as quality customer service that adds brownie
points to the customer experience. </p>



<h3>Reception Services</h3>



<p>While the company’s front desk should be managed by a receptionist, a hospitality business may still excel its customer experience by outsourcing its reception services. Upon outsourcing, the offshore receptionists can answer and route every incoming call whereas the onsite receptionist can focus on attending guests.&nbsp; This way, a customer no longer has to wait for the front desk receptionist to be free to take their calls and can get their issues and requirements resolved quickly and efficiently. It leads to greater customer satisfaction and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-omnichannel-customer-service-best-practices-to-boost-customer-experience.html">richer customer experience</a>. </p>



<h3>Research and Analytics</h3>



<p>While expanding its horizon or entering a new market a
hospitality business needs to have a good idea about what the customers want,
to deliver a quality customer service and a great customer experience. In such
a situation, hiring a BPO to do consumer behavior research, market research and
analytics would be far cost-effective a solution that carrying out the research
with an in-house team. The professional researchers from a BPO will be able to
provide them with a detailed report of the scenario and help them make informed
decisions. Such researches will also help a hospitality business shape their
customer experience. </p>



<p>Hoteliers, restaurateurs, and spa-owners can use outsourcing to cut costs and improve the quality of their services at the same time. When a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com">professional customer service call center</a> handles some of the customer service duties of hospitality business, it becomes easier to serve the guests in person and through various other communication channels. That is the right way to woo an ever-connected consumer base. </p>



<p>As a multilingual multi-channel BPO service provider Fusion efficiently supports English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin and others &#8211; through various communication channels and can, therefore, support any customer service process of a hospitality business. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In recent years, the airlines industry has faced major
challenges like rising fuel cost, changes in environmental regulations, and an
ever-rising customer expectation. To cope with them, most airlines are looking
for ways to reduce cost while meeting the environmental regulations and
customer expectations. </p>



<p>In such a situation, business process outsourcing (BPO) can
offer the airlines industry fast and simple solutions that help small and
medium airlines survive the tumulus time and prepare them for future growth and
expansion. The BPO solutions include a number of benefits including cost
reduction, the biggest challenge for airlines these days. These are: </p>



<ul><li>Reduction of the cost structures and making it
transparent</li><li>Focus on the customers’ needs despite
cost-cutting</li><li>Customer retention</li><li>Better planning capacity and inventory
management based on hard data </li><li>Consolidation of delivery operations to
standardize business processes</li></ul>



<p>Thanks to the latest technological breakthroughs, BPOs today can provide a wide number of <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/travel-transportation-hospitality.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="custom solutions to the airlines industry (opens in a new tab)">custom solutions to the airlines industry</a>. From AI-assisted customer service to rescheduling, delays, and cancellation assistance, a modern BPO can handle it all.&nbsp; Some of the most popular processes that airlines are outsourcing to BPOs are:</p>



<p><strong>Ticketing</strong> – BPOs
are equipped to handle ticketing and reservation processes for airlines of any
size.&nbsp; </p>



<p><strong>Customer Service</strong>
– Customer service has been a forte of BPOs from the very beginning. With
AI-assistance, customer service agents are now better equipped to help the
customers faster and with increased efficiency.</p>



<p><strong>Online Payments Processing (Payment IVR) with Fraud Detection </strong>– Any <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/recognitions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="PCI-DSS certified BPO (opens in a new tab)">PCI-DSS certified BPO</a> can process online payment securely on behalf of an airline. From secure payment processing to fraud detection, everything is done with astute precision.</p>



<p><strong>Flight Information Services

inquiries in real time. </p>



<p><strong>Rescheduling,

<p><strong>Lost Baggage Tracing and Customer Support</strong> – Lost baggage tracing can be quite frustrating to a customer.

them retain more customers.</p>

enter a new market. And no one can manage a sales campaign better than a BPO. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disengaged employees have always been a major issue in the BPO industry. If employees are not fully engaged in their tasks, they tend to under perform. This may cost the company dearly. That is not all, the disengaged agents are often the first ones to jump ship causing the high level of attrition often seen at call centers.</p>
<p>With such major effects on call center performance, employee engagement should not be taken lightly. Steps ought to be taken to prevent disengagement at all costs.</p>
<p>Fusion has faced similar problems in the past and has found that a number of things trigger disengagement. Want to know about them? let’s dig in.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of recognition</strong> – When an agent’s good deeds go unnoticed or the Supervisors do not re agonize their high-quality performance; the Agent tends to feel dejected and disheartened.  This may lead to a dip in his/her morale.</li>
<li><strong>Repetitive work</strong> – Call center work is more or less repetitive and it’s easy to lose interest in the work.  As a result, employees become less engaged.</li>
<li><strong>Unpleasant co-worker or Supervisor</strong> – Supervisors are often the number one cause of employee attrition. Unpleasant co-workers too can affect employee engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of advancement</strong> – According to many, the chance of advancement and learning new skills are slim in a call center environment. Add to it the repetitive functions and you will find that the employees may find it hard to stay engaged for a long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, what can a call center do to improve the situation? Well, a business can handle numerous problems, while the others they cannot. Take the repetitive work for example, a problem no call center can solve. As for the other issues, appropriate measures can be taken.</p>
<p>Here are a few practical solutions to assuage employee disengagement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognize every effort</strong>: &#8211; when an employee makes sincere effort to excel on the job, the effort has to be recognized individually and in team meetings.  By doing so, a company will ensure that no good performance or innovation goes unnoticed and at the same time, other employees tend to be motivated.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain a healthy work environment</strong>:- A healthy work environment can solve a host of problems.  If an employee is treated well by his/her Supervisor and colleagues, his/her morale will boost and it will eventually make him/her more engaged.</li>
<li><strong>Hold the Managers accountable</strong>:- when the Managers are held accountable for disengagement and attrition, they are more likely to take initiatives regarding employee engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Let the HR department take initiative</strong>:- to keep the work environment interesting even when the work itself is repetitive, the HR department needs to make a sincere effort. The effort can be as simple as occasional team luncheon or Intra-organization quiz competition. Anything that keeps things interesting on the work front, will engage the employees and be welcome ones.</li>
<li><strong>Help the agents learn new skills</strong> – allow the agents to learn new skills that will not only make their task easier but also help them in their future endeavours. It can be as simple as  learning advanced excel lessons to learning a new language. This will not only assist the employees in improving their performance but also will keep them engaged. An enhanced skill set will also help an employee grow within an organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are a few ways fusion tackles its employee disengagement problem.  So far, these small changes have worked wonders in our favor.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From where it started more than 20 years ago, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) today has come a long way.  As a matter of fact, the BPO industry is one of the fastest changing industries in the world.</p>
<p>With each technological innovation, BPO industry, as we know it, is going through a sea change. In a proper evaluation of BPOs you can very well understand the evolution of the industry. If you look at the Accenture whitepaper, you will be able to <a href="http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture-Next-Generation-BPO.pdf">identity 6 generation of BPOs</a> though the ages.</p>
<p>If a company plans to get the most out of their BPO partners, they have to understand the evolution of BPOs and ensure that they are dealing with a BPO with futuristic outlook. So, let’s take a quick look at the past, present and the future of the BPO industry to know the difference.</p>
<h3>The Past</h3>
<p><strong>First Generation:</strong></p>
<p>In early 1990s, the prime focus of the first generation of BPO was cost cutting. Companies used to outsource their non-core operations, around human resources, or finance and accounting to BPOs. This outsourcing was characterized by the rebadging of people within an organization and technology from client to provider in the same locations.</p>
<p><strong>Second Generation:</strong></p>
<p>Off shoring was the most prominent feature of the second generation BPOs.  During this stage, global labor arbitrage made it possible to move jobs to different parts of the world that could be done more cost effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Third Generation:</strong></p>
<p>By the induction of third generation of BPO, companies began outsourcing a wider range of functions with BPO providers who are focused on industrialization as well as process efficiency.  Leading providers began to use process methodologies such as Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma to standardize their operations.</p>
<h3>The Present</h3>
<p>Even today cost-cutting remains a valuable outcome from the early generations of BPO.  However, many executives are of opinion that BPO can be a more sophisticated tool for driving innovation as well as business value.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth Generation:</strong></p>
<p>In fact, a <a href="http://www.horsesforsources.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/High-Performance-BPO_Webcastdeck_Finalv21.pdf">survey by Horses for Sources</a> and The Outsourcing Unit at The London School of Economics in 2011 showed that a gap exists in achieving cost reduction and driving innovation. According to respondents, 46% of outsourcing initiatives were effective at operational cost reduction. However, only 11% of initiatives were (as per the respondents) as effective in offering new and creative methods of achieving business value.</p>
<p>At present, in the fourth generation of BPO, the top service providers are addressing this gap, mining huge amount of client data and using analytics to get actionable insights. This added value includes everything from increased speed to market, and stronger customer loyalty, to better talent management, as well as top-line growth.</p>
<p>The BPO service providers of this generation are combining industry expertise with descriptive and predictive analytics to help executives get a fair idea about what is happening in their businesses at this point of time as well as what possibilities the future holds. Based on these insights an effective strategy can be chalked out and in this process, the BPO provider becomes an active partner who plays a major role in their client’s success.</p>
<p><strong>Fifth Generation:</strong></p>
<p>Apart from this value-creation model of 4<sup>th</sup> generation BPOs, a 5<sup>th</sup> generation of BPO is emerging. This type of BPOs embrace not only analytics but software-as-a-service as well as mobile technology to offer a more flexible, on-demand BPO service that is supplied to multiple clients via flexible software platforms.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>If you look at the past and the present of BPO industry, you will find an inspiring history of progress and development. But what the future has in store for BPO? What will be the next generation for BPOs?</p>
<p>At Fusion, we believe that as the adoption of social networking continues in every sphere, it will help BPO move into a sixth generation. Business people are using such technologies more and more to build networks where members share best and worst practices, as well as discuss solutions to problems.</p>
<p>Social networking BPOs will act as an extension to the fifth generation BPO platforms that are based on BPO-provided processes. The platforms created in the fifth generation BPOs would be complemented by integrated online networks which will link both clients and providers.</p>
<p>While there are many BPO providers who are still viewing BPO exclusively as a cost-reduction tool, they are becoming increasingly out of step with what the clients want from a BPO. In order to offer the most value to clients today, providers need to actively accumulate the capabilities of fourth and fifth generation BPO and top it off with social networking integration to make a difference.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the ever-growing world of competition, businesses are becoming more and more dependent on BPOs for a large section of their core and non-core operations. BPOs are responsible for boosting revenue, maximizing productivity and reducing overhead cost.</p>
<p>As a result, the BPO industry today faces challenges in fields of Information management and Reporting.  The <a href="http://www.datamark.net/blog/10-bpo-trends-in-2013" target="_blank">upsurge in Big Data</a> and Social Media has made things even more difficult. Thankfully all these problems can be solved with the use of Business intelligence solutions.</p>
<p>A Business Intelligence system can help BPOs in <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/vikramkole/1-key-value-proposition-for-bpo" target="_blank">many areas</a> such as collecting data from customer interactions, analyzing it to understanding of what a customer wants. It also converts the data into actionable recommendations which can improve the performance of each department.</p>
<p>So how exactly can business intelligence improve the performance and operation of a BPO? Let’s find out.</p>
<h3>Operations: Efficiency vs. Cost –</h3>
<p>To attain success, BPOs need to strike a balance between cost and efficiency and that can be quite a challenging task.   A Business Intelligence system can offer the entire operation process with accurate information available at the right time to right people.</p>
<p>It provides with analytics to measure &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li>The factors that are affecting the efficiency and</li>
<li>The factors affecting the cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>With such information available at hand, BPO Managers can strike the right balance between both by making informed decisions.</p>
<h3>Performance Management –</h3>
<p>Managers can now take a break from time consuming data collection and reporting. The Performance management solution can empower them to capture as well as share customer data across the company.</p>
<p>The solution includes a series of procedures and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-technologies-boost-up-the-kpi.html" target="_blank">Key Performance Indicators</a> (KPIs) that needs to be captured, tracked as well as reported in order to make sure that departmental objectives are being met.</p>
<p>BPOs of every types and sizes can depend on Analytics and Reports to quantify the performance and take suitable actions to boost agent performance and lessen the effective operational cost.</p>
<h3>Knowledge Management –</h3>
<p>Intellectual capital and its successful use will be the key to gain competitive advantage in the rapidly changing global economy. Business Intelligence system can offer a basis for an end-to-end information management.</p>
<p>Using a Data Warehouse with Business Intelligence will allow an organization-wide system to cultivate new knowledge to gain competitive advantage, enabling access to a wide range of project as well as process information and sharing the best practices evolved in this course of working.</p>
<h3>Faster &amp; Accurate Results –</h3>
<p>Accurate reports and analytics can assist management with higher efficiency and in turn better customer satisfaction. Business Intelligence can integrate information from different systems in the BPO and fuse it into a single, easy to manage data repository to be used for providing personalized performance dashboards, automated reports as well as advanced analytical capabilities including drill-down, sorting and filtering.</p>
<p>We at Fusion believe that BPOs can offer major business value to their customers by deploying Business Intelligence.</p>
<p>From enhancing the top line to finding new avenues to reduce bottom line; from analytics on recruitment to retention; from trend analysis to customer retention; from profits to expenses; &#8211; Business Intelligence can provide enormous benefits.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BPO industry today is one of the most prominent industries in India, providing millions of jobs. However, it is also an industry with high attrition levels.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Cellular Phone / Laptop:</strong> Cellular phone and / or Laptop are provided to the employees on the basis of business need. Whereas, the employee is responsible for the maintenance and safeguarding of the asset. At Fusion, we provide eligible employees with laptop/cell phone facility. Safekeeping of the same is the responsibility of the employee.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Health Care (Regular medical check-ups):</strong> Some of the BPOs provide the facility for general health check-up. For employees with above 40 years of age, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151259134637873.526086.184998332872&amp;type=3" target="_blank">medical check-up</a> can be done once a year. At Fusion we offer health camps at our office premises every year.</li>
<li><strong>Skill development:</strong> Fusion always encourages its employees to learn and develop new skills.  For this reason, the company often arrange for skill development training and personality development training.</li>
<li><strong>Performance based incentives:</strong> Many BPO companies today have plans for, performance based incentive scheme. Process performance i.e. speeds; accuracy and productivity of each process are considered to b the parameters for calculation. At Fusion we too have performance based incentives to all our employees.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Get together and other cultural programs:</strong> The BPO companies organize cultural programs as and when possible. Through this program the companies provide its employees with the opportunity to showcase their talents in singing, acting, drawing etc.  At Fusion too we organize competitions, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151616239737873.1073741826.184998332872&amp;type=3" target="_blank">rangoli making</a>, poster drawing and many other events. We also like to celebrate festivities with our employees. We also conduct various intra-office sports programs such as Cricket, football, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Referral Scheme:</strong> Several companies implement employee referral scheme to encourage employees to refer friends and relatives for employment in the company.  At Fusion too we have a similar kind of referral scheme for our employees.</li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from these benefits, Fusion also takes care of the well-being of its employees. That’s the reason they shifted most of their non-voice processes to day shift so that a large section of their employees can work in the morning shift.</p>
<p>Those who work on night shifts also get rotational shifts so that they too do not have to work in the wee hours at night. Working against the biological clock may often lead to health issues. Fusion does not want its employees, who are the true assets of the company.</p>
<p>Fusion believes in the motto that if you are truly interested in your employees, they too stay interested in you. We make an effort to retain talent and our hard work often pays off.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finances are the eminent part of your business, and they are the sole connector to achieve and clear and accurate picture of your business. Whatever may be the size of your business – small or large, you have to ensure that all financial transactions get recorded accurately and enables you to take informed decisions based on the solid data.</p>
<p>Fusion has brought out the popular reason why popular companies like to outsource their financial transaction to offshore contact centers. Is it just cost affordability and flexibility or something more?</p>
<h3>#1. Time Is Valuable &amp; Time Is Money</h3>
<p>Many business owners do their bookkeeping at their own as they are not having enough to hire a bookkeeper to do the job. No matter whatever may be the size of your business, you should be spending your time doing that in which you are the best and that’s: <b>Running Your Business!</b></p>
<p>Do consider hiring an efficient, well-trained, skillful outsourced bookkeeper to keep up with the bookkeeping needs. It may be once per week, or once per month, an outsourced bookkeeper is able to provide books and maintains accurate records on which you can work upon anytime without hampering your core business aspects.</p>
<h3>#2. Get the Satisfaction</h3>
<p>We know how stressful it is to run a business – you do not need to add pressure of wondering if the books are accurate or whether the bills are paid on time. An outsourced bookkeeper will help you alleviate the stress. Do you face trouble while preparing the budgets? Do you need help in strategic planning? Don’t you think that will be a smoother if you get the assistance of a CFO? With the help of a CFO, you can browse through different options that you might have taken while deciding upon major decisions.</p>
<h3>#3. Stay Consistent</h3>
<p>There are businesses that use untrained employees to do the books say for part-time basis and often concluded that the records are incomplete and inconsistent. These irregularities are often very confusing and can multiply over time. It makes hard for you to get an accurate financial of your company. An outsourced bookkeeper can work with you and can develop procedures helps you to develop the process, and procedures tailored to your business so that you can get a refined picture of your business.</p>
<h3>#4. Cost Affordability</h3>
<p>The key to unlock the profits in business is efficient financial management. You need to have an accurate record of the financial transactions that will help you to take further decisions. It may be expensive, and at times, you feel that it is unnecessary to hire a full-time bookkeeper, Controller or CFO. However, your business needs one of them, but not all of them at a time. Outsourced financial professional at Fusion does them as per your needs. You just pay only for the task that you need your outsourcers to do on behalf of you.</p>
<h3>#5. Get Flexibility Over Transactions</h3>
<p>Some of the common situation, which often business owners face:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a seasonal business thus needs extra helping hands during the busy season.</li>
<li>Bookkeeper going on a vacation thus needs a replacement.</li>
<li>Financial controller quitted suddenly and thus financial management goes sunken.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all above situation outsourcing, your financial services to an outsourced call center are the solution. What you get with the outsourced partner like Fusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experienced bookkeeper</li>
<li>Controller or CFO</li>
</ul>
<p>They help you to decide on the right steps and fill the role, which you might need to play as long as required and thus avoid any kind of interruption to business. These are the basic five advantages, which you might find with every financial outsourcing partner, and Fusion is not the only exception.</p>
<p><b>Nevertheless, what makes Fusion stand apart? 5M’s rock the performance @Fusion<br />
</b></p>
<ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you joined a BPO job recently? Are you a recent graduate? Then the high pay scale, hip-n-happening work environment and fun-loving colleagues are surely going to make you happy.</p>
<p>Working in a BPO gives you the scope to enjoy a great nightlife with late night parties, pub party, boozing in bars since all these seem to you as the sign of <b>‘<em>good life</em>’</b>. However, the other side should also be considered.</p>
<p>Yes, BPO jobs do have some odd ends, which ultimately make you suffer from health loss. Some common bad effects of a BPO job are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graveyard shift brings on depressions and ill health</li>
<li>Erratic sleeping patterns</li>
<li>Improper diet</li>
<li>Meals consumed at odd hours</li>
</ul>
<p>The results of these bad habits – (are far worse) – <b>feeling old quite early, tired, ill and depressed</b>. Fusion BPO Services has been in the industry since 9 years, and we are savvy enough about the good and bad side of BPO jobs. Through this blog, we want our employees to suit the lifestyle of a BPO job rather than get frenzied over it.</p>
<p>According to the University Of The Philippines’ Population Institute And The International Labor Organization a <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---safework/documents/instructionalmaterial/wcms_178396.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> done in 2010 revealed that half of the BPO workers experience <b>fatigue</b> (54%) and <b>insomnia</b> (47.7%). The situation is similar in every country that has a growing BPO industry. Therefore, we thought to share some cracking ideas to save our workers from the monotony of their job.</p>
<p>What is the solution?  &#8211; To get a balance in your work life and to match with the BPO lifestyle you need to adapt two mantras:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking enough rest</li>
<li>Eating the right food</li>
</ul>
<p>Fusion is going to share five great exciting tips to help the employee agree with the BPO lifestyle. Do you want to explore more? So here we go.</p>
<h3><i>Tip 1: Load Enough Proteins Before You Enter the Graveyard Shift</i></h3>
<p>Which types of food are rich sources of protein? Well, <b>grilled fish, chicken, eggs, tofu, soybean </b>and<b> nuts</b> are highly rich in proteins. Protein gained from foods is converted into amino acids by our body, and thus help to build muscles and blood. Protein saves you from the unnecessary fatigues. Have enough protein from now if you work on a night shift!</p>
<h3><i>Tip 2: Say ‘Yes’ To Carbs</i></h3>
<p>Carbs are not always bad. Your body needs a certain amount of it. Yes, the foods rich in carbohydrate and tryptophan <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/serotonin-boosters/" target="_blank">produce serotonin</a>, a hormone that regulates mood, sleep, learning, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction" target="_blank">vasoconstriction</a> (constriction of blood vessels). <b>Whole grains</b> and <b>fruits</b> are a good source of carbohydrate. You may also try vegetables such as <b>potatoes, parsnips</b>, and <b>beans</b>. For gaining tryptophan, consume <b>cheese, chicken, tofu, soy, sesame, pumpkin seeds</b> and <b>turkey</b>. A diet enriched with carbohydrate and tryptophan will help you to sleep better.</p>
<h3><i>Tip 3: Dinner before 8 PM</i></h3>
<p>Try to finish your dinner by 8PM. This will help you to give some time to your body to digest the food. Since, human science says after 8PM metabolism reduces largely. Therefore, it becomes harder for the body to digest food.</p>
<h3><em> Tip 4: Workout and Exercise</em><b><i></i></b></h3>
<p>Figure out what kind of exercise will suit you. You have different ways to keep your body fit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workout in a gym</li>
<li>Swim few laps in a pool</li>
<li>Yoga sessions</li>
<li>Power yoga</li>
<li>Aerobics</li>
<li>Zumba</li>
<li>Pilates</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the exercise that suits you the best and make it a part of your life. Exercise will let you boost the brainpower, keep off the diseases and ward off mental stress. You will be able to build a positive mindset as <a href="http://www.rd.com/slideshows/8-ways-to-naturally-increase-endorphins/" target="_blank">regular exercise</a> releases endorphins (happy hormones).</p>
<h3><i>Tip 5: A Big ‘No’ to Caffeine and Nicotine</i></h3>
<p>The call center workers have a tendency to drink a lot of coffee in a day. You can have a substitute in that case. Try <b>buttermilk, herbal tea, green tea</b> and <b>basil tea</b>. Green tea has anti-oxidants <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/food-nutrition/facts/antioxidant.htm" target="_blank">that help</a> to neutralize free radicals. It’s good to be a non-smoker, don’t get tempted to smoke. Smoking can ruin your health and can lead to premature aging and early death at a younger age. Try to <a href="http://www.cancer.org/healthy/stayawayfromtobacco/guidetoquittingsmoking/guide-to-quitting-smoking-toc" target="_blank">quit smoking</a>.</p>
<p>Some healthy signs after you quit smoking:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Leaving smoking after a month, the blood circulation and lung-function increases.</i></li>
<li><i>Within 9 months, coughing and shortness of breath decreases.</i></li>
<li><i>Within 1-year heart diseases reduces. </i></li>
<li><i>Within five and ten years, you will avoid the risk of lung cancer.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Fusion is presently having several thousand employees in their graveyard shifts in the four contact center cities – <b>United States, Canada, India </b>and<b> Philippines.</b> We advise our employees to take up these great habits to modify their lifestyle and thus enjoy their BPO job in a relaxed manner.</p>
<p>Make room for the good things to start happening in your life as soon as possible. Balance your work and personal life now! Start following the tips today!!!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent economic survey on service sectors of India shows a steady increase in the employment scale by 6.94 lakh during the last year in outsourcing industry.</p>
<p>Well, the figure is around 7 lakh approximately and it is not a simple figure. Overall employment in the IT and BPO sector of India has seen almost half of the increase in 2012, than the preceding years. It has been since July 2009 that India witnesses employment demand to rise despite the economic downturn.</p>
<h3>Call Center Job: The Hot Trend</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2012-13/echap-10.pdf" target="_blank">Economic Survey for the year 2012-13</a> tabled in the <a href="http://loksabha.nic.in/" target="_blank">Lok Sabha</a> (Parliament of India) shows that the steady development in the employment structure contributes a lot to the human development. This is of great economic significance to BPO sectors in India provided that the measures taken to seize the &#8220;demographic dividend&#8221;.</p>
<p>As we know that the younger generation infest the BPO sectors more than any other age groups, so the working &#8211; age population, between 15 and 59 years are likely to grow by 64% in the year 2021. Moreover, new entrants around 63.5 million had an influx in the call center industry this year.</p>
<p>The booming population of India, perennially scouting for jobs, has found that call centers are the most dependable source. It has given financial opportunities to the number of youth. At Fusion, after doing some  researches we have found that people hired by contact centers of India expected to grow 50% annually.</p>
<h3>Battling The Attrition Rates</h3>
<p>One of the annoying problems that dog the outsourcing industry is the work ethic. People hired in the contact center industry is volatile. They are moving with the trend <b><i>&#8216;here today, gone tomorrow&#8217;. </i></b>The constant shifting of jobs pull down the operational qualities like – discipline, endurance, loyalty and respect for the management.</p>
<p>Though the employment has scope increased in the last year by 7 lakh, attrition rates shoot up 50% every year. Human resource manager finds it tough to battle out the tough problem of attrition. Being the leader in contact centers Fusion too faces the similar problems of attrition.</p>
<p>However, attrition was previously a major concern, but with the increase in the employment scope, attrition rates have started to decline. What is the cause? – Well, the cause is changes in macroeconomic element of the industry according to the <a href="http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2013-14/frbm/frbm1.pdf" target="_blank">Macroeconomic Framework Statement</a> by Union Budget 2013-2014. Macroeconomic conditions are having a great impact on the attrition rates. This allows the outsourcing companies to let their employee enjoy long-term career growth and security.</p>
<h3>Factors Contributing Towards the Growth of BPO Career</h3>
<ul>
<li>Low operational costs and tax benefits</li>
<li>Favorable government policies</li>
<li>Technically sound employees present in the country itself</li>
<li>Adoption of advanced IT technologies</li>
<li>Growth in export demand from various new verticals</li>
<li>Use of innovative technologies like cloud computing</li>
<li>Set up of more <a class="zem_slink" title="Special economic zone" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_economic_zone" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">SEZ</a> in Tier II cities</li>
</ul>
<p>Above 7 factors largely contributes to the growth of Indian BPO industry to have a strong competitive position and a market share. NASSCOM survey report says that rural areas are going to boost ten times by 2013-2014, compared to the year 2009-2010. <a href="http://strategyand.pwc.com/global/home/press/article/48213011" target="_blank">Booz and Co</a> have conducted a survey poll and has found that India is the ideal destination for offshoring that encourages foreign companies to offshore their products to Indian ITeS companies.</p>
<p>With all these elements and considering the macroeconomic situation of India, 2013 is surely going to enjoy en employment boos, 99.9% customer and employee satisfaction as well.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is often essential for hospitals and the medical practitioners to look for the best medical answering service. Not just to keep their customers satisfied with the happy retreat but to make them gain  confidence on the company and their products/services.</p>
<p>When you choose a contact center who offers you with <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">medical answering service</a>, you have to consider its every potential point, like – the price charged, CSR training, 24/7 support and testimonials from the previous clients.</p>
<p>However, if you want to secure the information of your customers and you are cautious about their exchange, then make sure that the answering service you choose is <a class="zem_slink" title="Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">HIPAA</a> Compliant. This is the topmost priority, which your contact center must possess to make their answering services totally confidential and safe for your customers or patients.</p>
<h3>HIPAA &#8211; What is it?</h3>
<p>Came into action by the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3103.ENR:" target="_blank">Congress in 1996</a>, HIPAA or the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act. It was established to protect every patient’s privacy and to make sure that the patients’ files never get shared with another party without the patient&#8217;s consent, preferably written consent. If your business deals with patients, then you have to activate the medical answering service and make sure that the contact center who disburses such service are HIPAA compliant.</p>
<h3>What Should You Look In A Medical Answering Service?</h3>
<p>You have to make sure that the answering service provider is in full compliance with HIPAA. Fusion and their customer representatives have completed the appropriate training to meet all kinds of regulations. Our agents attend regular training and workshops in order to stay on the top of any new <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/index.html" target="_blank">HIPAA regulations</a>. We also take care while training each CSR on how to deal with patients on the phone, when they discuss the information, which are extremely personal. CSRs have to be sensitive and reassure that the caller and his information remain secure in our hand.</p>
<p>You also have to check that the contact center and their staff are not just answering the phone call of the patients but helping patients with health information. Make sure that the contact centers give them the proper training. Check with the vendor that the data is stored, and they have a disaster security and recovery system to restrict the potential hackers or any kind of system failures.</p>
<p>We update out our answering service technology at Fusion, since being the leader in BPO services, we know regular updates can prevent the future errors.</p>
<h3>Security Measures</h3>
<p>An answering service must possess some other things so that they can ensure that the patient’s information and data are safe in their hand. Go through this following list to know what the leading contact center can offer you through the answering service. Make sure you choose a contact center who is HIPAA Compliant.</p>
<ol>
<li>Protected email portals</li>
<li>Having fax covers that include privacy statements</li>
<li>No visitors allowed in the secured areas</li>
<li>Secure systems installed to dispose medical data</li>
<li>System to hide the information to those who walk by</li>
</ol>
<p>Fusion implements all these rules at the contact center to give the real retreat to their customers, as well as their business clients.</p>
