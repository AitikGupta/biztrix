<h3>BRIDGE &#8211; Building Ripples In a Diversified Global Environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>On 11th of May 2019 history was made in Fusion BPO Cebu.  It was the very first time that all leaders from Subject Matter Experts to Team Leads to Account Managers and Supervisors, Department Heads, together with Fusion Philippines&#8217; Country Head, Mr. Nagarajan &#8220;<em>Raj</em>&#8221; Anandaraman, gathered together in one forum, through a Leadership Summit called <strong>Fusion BRIDGE</strong>. </p>

<p>The Program kicked off with an energetic Welcome Address from Raj who opened the ceremony with an in-depth discussion about innovation in the contact center industry.&nbsp; It was then followed by our&nbsp;Head of Operations, Barbara Atillo-Alovera&#8217;s cascade on What&#8217;s Next for the Organization, 2018 Site-Wide Highlights, and the 3-Year Roadmap for Fusion Cebu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next phase of the summit covered all the 2018 Achievements, 2019&nbsp;Year-round plans and the What&#8217;s-In-It-For-Me (WIIFM) discussion&nbsp;from IT, HR, Corporate Training, Operations, Workforce, Quality, and Facilities/Infrastructure c/o each Department Head &#8211; Darwin Aloot, Ana Maria Pugoy, Ana Aviso, Barbara Atillo-Alovera, Mark Ferdinand Soller, Lyn Ybanez, and Michael Teves.</p>

<p>The most exciting, inspirational, and educational part of the day-long activity was the Executive Fireside Chat, which was graced by our very own Co-Founder / Chief Operations Officer, Sir Kishore Saraogi, and Sir Raj who not only shared their success stories, but also showed their fun side by giving life to some of the personal questions in lieu with Work-Life-Balance.</p>



<p>There was never a dull moment during the second half of the Program as all participants came ready with their root causes,&nbsp;creative ideas, suggestions, solutions,&nbsp;and recommendations.&nbsp; They brainstormed in three (3) competitive groups, during the Break-out sessions, to help address 3 pain points in lieu with&nbsp;the following categories:</p>



<h4>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;People</h4>



<ul><li>Retention</li><li>Engagement</li><li>Sourcing</li></ul>



<h4>2.&nbsp; Processes &amp; Procedures</h4>



<ul><li>Communication Channels</li><li>Reporting &amp; Automation</li><li>Infrastructure &amp; Technology</li></ul>



<h4>3.&nbsp; Growth</h4>



<ul><li>Revenue</li><li>Organic growth</li><li>People-Process Perspective</li></ul>



<p>It was an absolute proud moment to see all great minds think in unison to help eradicate major problems in the company.&nbsp; The takeaways were truly abundant as the activity came to a close c/o Program Manager Deborah Jane &#8220;<em>DJ</em>&#8221;&nbsp;Labastida.&nbsp; Everyone cannot wait for next year&#8217;s summit.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, all Management members, Delegates, and Leaders went home with smiles in their faces with the commitment to: &#8220;<strong><em>Transform Tomorrow Together</em></strong>.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fusion BPO Services is a leading name in the global outsourcing industry known for its quality of service, a variety of service offering, and a high growth rate. Recently we have added a new contact center in Tirana, Albania, South-Eastern Europe. With this new center, Fusion continues to increase its global footprint.</p>
<p>By adding highly-skilled and multilingual resources to its team Fusion aims to strengthen their position as a global leader in outsourcing services and comprehensively cater to the varied outsourcing needs of its clients worldwide.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how our Albania center can support you better:</p>
<p><strong>Increased Language Support</strong> – Apart from English, employees speak a number of languages including French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Greek.  Portuguese, Russian, and Dutch are the most common second languages in Albania. Therefore, we can provide an outsourcing service in a language your customers speak and understand, thus eliminating the communication gap.</p>
<p><strong>Highly Tech-savvy Resources </strong>&#8211; Albanian labor force is highly educated and skilled, and such resources are definitely going to help Fusion to serve various outsourcing needs of its clients both in Europe and America.</p>
<p><strong>Location Advantage</strong> – By securing good ranking on the ‘Doing Business’ <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/albania">rankings</a> by the World Bank for three consecutive years, Albania has become one of the most sought after outsourcing destination in South-east Europe. Apart from being a perfect nearshore outsourcing destination for our European clients, the outsourcing industry of Albania boasts cheap but highly-skilled workforce, making it an ideal outsourcing destination for our clients across the globe.</p>
<p>To sum it up, our clients can now enjoy the benefits of a cost-effective, resource-rich, multilingual outsourcing destination in Europe that is more than capable of supporting all your outsourcing needs in over 9 languages.</p>
<p>We hope that our new center will not only help us expand our global footprint but will also help our clients reach their business goals with the same dedication and efficiency they have come to expect from the brand named Fusion BPO Services.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On this “<strong>World No Tobacco Day</strong>”, Fusion shares its concern that every organization should have for their employees, and as is the case here… about employee health.  It is especially true for call centers, as it is no secret that the job of a call center employee is a tough one.</p>
<p>Dealing with sometimes <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/7-ways-customer-service-rep-can-deal-with-irate-customer.html" target="_blank">irate customers</a>, handling graveyard shifts, and adhering to aggressive deadlines, can often compel a call center executive to indulge in smoking and drinking caffeinated drinks much too often.</p>
<p>All call center agents experience stress from time to time, and each has different ways to deal with it. For many of them, smoking cigarettes is a great escape. They claim that smoking calms their nerves and helps them relax. If you take a careful look, a large component of any call center’s workforce is known to be smokers.</p>
<p>But other than stress relieving there are other reasons for which they prefer smoking. According to them, smoking breaks being shorter can be taken several times a day. So, it gives them a sense of well deserved but short breaks. As smoking is usually done in a group, it also allows them to feel a sense of camaraderie.</p>
<p>While these are some common ideas that call center employees have about smoking, the true picture is far from that. Nowhere is it proven that nicotine is a stress reliever. As a matter of fact, smoking does not improve a stressful situation but rather will more likely lead to many <a href="http://smokefree.gov/health-effects">health risks</a>.</p>
<p>However, with an effort, even the most frequent smoker can give up this terrible addiction. But, most people will find it hard to overcome this terrible dependency. It is not just a matter of willpower and determination. It is also about creating a support group around the smoker who will help him/her from smoking and see to it that he/she does not find himself/herself in a situation of smoking.</p>
<p>This is where the employer can integrated into the picture. Some businesses across the world consider smoking inside office premises acceptable and allow their employees to smoke on the premises. At Fusion, we have declared each of our centers as smoke-free zones. So, while our employees are inside office premises, our employees must abstain from smoking.</p>
<p>Apart from this, consumption of any tobacco product and nicotine infused gum, as well as practicing any other addictions is strictly prohibited inside our offices.</p>
<p>We encourage our employees to maintain a good diet, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/fusion-shares-5-great-habits-to-match-the-lifestyle-of-a-bpo-job.html">healthy habits</a> and indulge in some physical activities as well.  We have also organized anti-smoking and fitness awareness camps in our different centers from time to time.</p>
<p>Overall, our sole concern is and has always been the physical and mental well-being of our workforce. We consider banning the consumption of tobacco products in our office premises as nothing but a baby step toward that goal. But we hope that these small steps will add up to lead our employees towards a healthier tomorrow.</p>
