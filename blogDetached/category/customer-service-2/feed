								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Great customer service is the need of the hour. If as an
organization you cannot provide good customer service you are sure to lose
their loyalty at some point in time. Therefore, you need to provide the best
possible service to your customer.</p>



<p>While every business today tries to <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html">provide excellent customer service</a> and reduce the customer effort with timely and effective support to improve their experience, it fails to recognize the most important aspect of delivering a customer experience – their employees who serve in a customer facing role. </p>



<p>If you make it difficult or the employees to do their job,
it will translate to the experience they deliver to your customers.&nbsp; Even if the difficult task is not directly
related to the customer, the frustration of doing that task somehow impacts the
employee-customer interaction. Also, it gradually makes your employees <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/reasons-and-remedies-of-employee-disengagement.html">disengaged</a>
resulting in an even poorer customer experience. Yet according to a CCW 2019 <a href="https://www.customercontactweekdigital.com/content-auto-download/5be9b822d1d92e406f3b64d1">study</a>,
most companies do not pay as much attention to reducing employee effort as they
do to personalization. </p>



<p>At Fusion, we give our employees utmost importance and
recognize their unique position in delivering a good customer experience. Therefore,
we always ask ourselves the following questions:</p>



<ul><li>What&#8217;s keeping employees from delivering the
great experience that your customers deserve?</li><li>Is there a way to simplify workflows and
processes?</li><li>How can we make it easier for employees to do their
job?</li><li>How do we make it easier for agents to deliver a
great customer experience by removing complexities, complications, and
bureaucracy?</li><li>Are there ways to reduce effort for employees
and ultimately, for customers?</li></ul>



<p>With our vast experience in the customer service industry,
we have found that making necessary changes to reduce the efforts of your employees
leads to improved customer experience. Here are a few suggestions on how to
turn things around for our employees, and eventually, for the customer.</p>



<h3>1. Walk In Your Employees&#8217; Shoes</h3>



<p>Walking in your employees’ shoes in the best way to
understand the effort they put every day. To do this, you can create any of the
two following things: </p>



<ol><li>Employee journey maps</li><li>Your own undercover executive program, in which executives take on the role of the employee. </li></ol>



<p>Once you understand the effort, you&#8217;ll be able to unearth
the inefficiencies and ready to improve the process. At Fusion, we have used
undercover executive program to see whether the employees are finding it easy
to do their job.</p>



<h3>2. Pay Attention To What Your Employees Are Saying</h3>



<p>Listen to what your employees are telling you. Watch them
work. If they say a process is difficult or pointless, you need to look into it
and fix it the best way you can. Ignoring it is not a wise decision.</p>



<h3>3. Ensure Employees Have The Right Tools</h3>



<p>When you define employee roles and expectations, make sure
that your employees have the knowledge, skills, training, and resources
required to do the job. &nbsp;Without the
right tool, training and knowledge they will not be able to provide prompt and
to-the-point solution to your customers, resulting in a poor customer
experience. </p>



<h3>4. Reduce Their Effort With Modern Technology </h3>



<p>At Fusion, we believe in providing our employees with the
most modern tools that make their jobs easier and less time consuming. For
example – if customer service agents get <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">AI
assistance</a> that brings all the data related to a customer on a single
dashboard, it helps them serve the customer better. Having an <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/benefits-of-adopting-omnichannel-customer-support.html">omnichannel</a>
environment makes it easier for the agents to ask suggestions of other agents
without putting the customer on hold and thus it reduces the agent effort and
ultimately the customer effort as well.</p>



<h3>5. Define The Idea Of A Great Customer Experience </h3>



<p>Giving your employees a clear idea about your customers will
help them understand what needs to be done. Defining the idea of a great
customer experience to them will give them a clear target and help them
understand how to get there. </p>



<h3>6. Provide Ongoing Feedback</h3>



<p>Giving your employees regular feedback and ongoing coaching provides
them with the guidance they need to follow the right path, to do things in a
better manner and to do it right every single time. Just like employee feedback
helps create a better process, giving regular feedback and training to the
employees help them deliver a better customer experience. According to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/11-employee-feedback-statistics">Hubspot</a>,
regular employee feedback can greatly impact employee engagement.</p>



<p>These are some useful tips that can help you reduce agent effort, root out the inefficiencies, and create a streamlined and simpler work process that makes the job easier for the employees. A simpler work process with the right tools and technology result in a better customer service while regular feedback and timely training boosts employee engagement. As a result, your employees are happy and your customers are happier.</p>



<p>Fusion has always been an advocate of reducing employee efforts and engaging them with timely feedback and training. We feel that when our agents are engaged, they provide a far more efficient customer support that boosts customer satisfaction. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Customer service has gone through a sea of changes in the
recent past. So far, the changes have helped businesses improve the quality of
customer service and deliver state-of-the-art customer experience.</p>



<p>So, what made businesses think that a change in their
customer service model is necessary? Here are four realities that compelled
businesses to rethink:</p>



<h3>1. Smartphones In Every Pocket </h3>



<p>Nowadays one can find heavily featured smartphones being used in different parts of the world. Pew Research <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2999631/phones/pew-survey-shows-68-percent-of-americans-now-own-a-smartphone.html">reports</a> that in 2015 68% of American adults owned smartphones, almost double the 35% penetration in 2011. That means nearly every American has a supercomputer in his or her pocket.</p>



<p>The smartphone and the tablet are all-purpose devices that let us interact in a variety of modes &#8211; phone, email, text, web chat, video chat, social media, online forums and much more. As a result, people do not want to stick with just one mode of communication at a time: they switch modes as they please, and expect companies to keep up so that they don&#8217;t have to repeat their back-story to different personnel along the way. </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>With a smartphone in every pocket, companies can no longer stick to just one or two customer interaction channels. They should be present in a variety of channels so that a customer can reach them easily via the channel of his/her choice. When it comes to customer service, omnichannel is the way to go. </p>



<p>With <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/benefits-of-adopting-omnichannel-customer-support.html">omnichannel customer service</a>, a customer receives a seamless experience across all channels. Now, that is a customer service model that never goes out of style.</p>



<h3>2. 5G </h3>



<p>Over the next two years, the transition from 4G to 5G will make the public wireless network experience a huge 300 times faster. With <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-5g-everything-you-need-to-know">5G</a>, we will see devoted slices of spectrum, ready for tuning and optimization for specific applications and devices. The blend of these two phenomena, when met with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-internet-things-affect-customer-service-near-future-saraogi/">IoT</a>/M2M devices, will facilitate secure real-time data transfer. That means no delay. </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>In the age of 5G the faster a company can put data into action, the more value it can deliver. This is only possible when you put AI into the mix. When your customer service agents get <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">real-time assistance from AI</a>, it will be possible for them to assist your customers right away.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5G.jpg" alt="5G" class="wp-image-6617" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5G.jpg 650w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5G-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></figure></div>



<p>Here’s an example – if you get a call from your customer that his/her car broke down in the middle of the road, your customer service agent can take help of AI to resolve the issue quickly. AI can quickly show the agent the actual location of your customer, the location of the nearest tow truck and the time it will take the tow truck to arrive. It can also notify the tow truck, show the agent the location of the nearest clinic in case the customer needs medical assistance, saving your agent the time to manually look for the information and make the necessary calls. As a result, you can provide your customer with real-time assistance.</p>



<h3>3. Getting Smart </h3>



<p>Smart watches, smart cars, smart TVs, and other smart
devices continue to have a mammoth impact on consumer-oriented experiences.
Companies are building customer experiences around smart connected devices and
reshaping customer expectations in the process. The effect in the B2B segment
will be just as remarkable and will go beyond the automatic or single-tap
wireless updating of software features and bug fixes. </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>For most people, the best customer experience would be one that provides problem resolution without them having to know about it. Otherwise, one where the device notifies customer service based on a data trigger, empowering the user to help solve the issue on his terms.</p>



<p>As we shoot up the connectivity, contact center agents and technicians will increasingly interact not only with people but also with a wide range of devices, requiring these experts to hone their skills to handle different questions and complex situations.</p>



<h3>4. Big Data Getting Bigger</h3>



<p>Considering the ABI Research <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240227341/IoT-enabled-devices-to-cross-40-billion-by-2020">report</a>
that IoT/M2M will reach 40 billion in 2020, it is safe to say that connected
devices will soon outnumber people 5:1 or more. And they will generate a lot of
data.&nbsp; To deliver excellent customer
service businesses has to process this data to put the right information into
the right Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>At present customer service agents get access to just the performance information and customer data available in the CRM. That is a small slice of data that is often segmented. To use big data to its full potential, businesses have to analyze all data points and spread it across an organization along with other data. AI, data science, and machine learning can help you with that. </p>



<p>These advanced technologies will help you process big data faster, analyze the data to get better understanding of your customers and their expectations and using the same for future customer interactions. They will help agents get the full picture and deliver faster resolution, create more upsell/cross-sell opportunities, and ultimately deliver a superior customer experience.</p>



<p>Smartphones, 5G, devices, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wearable-technology-change-face-customer-service-kishore-saraogi/">wearables</a>, as well as big data, will continue to bring positive changes in customer service. Is your customer service ready to deliver new customer experience? </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With self-service on the rise, many people believe that the
time is up for live human agents who have been the backbone of call center and
customer service industry. Fusion respectfully begs to differ. </p>



<p>Having more than 15 years of experience in the call center
industry, we have studied consumer behavior closely. And while customer support
has changed a lot over the years thanks to technological advancements like
self-service and AI, live agents still remain the most preferred choice for
customer support, especially in the complex cases. </p>



<p>Here are a few of our observations on the role of live
agents in the modern customer service industry:</p>



<h3>1. People Still Want To Interact With A Human Agent</h3>



<p>Customer service encounters through social media or self-service don’t always leave customers feeling great confidence. On the other hand, interacting with a fellow human can make your customers feel reassured. </p>



<p>Even the tech-savvy <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/provide-quality-customer-service-to-the-millennials.html">millennials</a> who prefer self-service and other technology-rich customer service channels, resort to interacting with live customer service agents via voice or <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">chat</a> when they face a complex issue.  </p>



<p>Therefore, live agents are still very much relevant in the modern customer service scene and if anything, they play a far more significant role today than the role it used to play earlier.</p>



<h3>2. Customers Want Easy Access To Live Agents</h3>



<p>No matter how technologically advanced a call center becomes, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/engage-your-agents-xfactor-quality-customer-experience.html">there is no alternative of human agents</a>.  Even today, customers are more comfortable to convey their unique issues to a human agent than to a chatbot or IVR. Therefore, customers must be given the choice to talk to a live human agent and the option should be clearly conveyed to the customer. Many businesses these days think so as well.</p>



<p>In the Customer Contact Week Digital market study, <a href="https://www.customercontactweekdigital.com/content-auto-download/5be9b822d1d92e406f3b64d1">64%</a> of respondents agreed that customers must have easy access to a live human agent.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY.jpg" alt="THE FUTURE OF THE CONTACT CENTER IN 2019" class="wp-image-6593" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY.jpg 801w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-300x285.jpg 300w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-768x729.jpg 768w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CCW-MARKET-STUDY-750x712.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></figure>



<p>As a call center with over 15 years of experience, Fusion has also seen that a customer is far more comfortable in discussing their issues with a human agent than telling it all to a faceless machine entity. They crave for the empathy that only a live human agent can deliver.</p>



<h3>3. Live Agents Can Handle Complex Issues Better</h3>



<p>All the issues handled by customer service can predominantly
be classified into two groups –</p>



<ul><li>Simple issues or inquiries </li><li>Complex problems</li></ul>



<p>Simple issues can be defined as issues that can be handled
within a single interaction or a basic issue reporting that can be resolved by
the company without additional customer input. These issues generally are
frequent and reoccurring and therefore, addressing them with automated channels
like knowledge-based systems, social media, improved website forms, text
messages, and chat systems makes complete sense. </p>



<p>However, when the problem is complex, automated channels fail to effectively resolve them. For this reason, most complex issues are handled over the phone.</p>



<p>It takes more time to explain the problem in detail so that the customer service agent can understand it, analyze it, and work on providing the resolution. However, the process can be improved by integrating AI with human agents.</p>



<h3>4. Artificial Intelligence Should Complement Human Agents Instead Of Replacing Them</h3>



<p>While <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Artificial Intelligence (opens in a new tab)">Artificial Intelligence</a> or AI is the buzzword in modern customer support, it is still not in a position where it can replace a human agent. AI is to go a long way before it can master the art of natural language processing (NLP) and empathy. Instead, it can be used to aid a live agent and make their job easier.  </p>



<p>For example – if one of your customers has an issue
regarding their bills, a live agent will take some time to find relevant
information. &nbsp;When AI is brought into the
scene, it will be able to show the agent the past interaction history on the
screen along with itemized billing so that it becomes easier for the agent to
promptly resolve the issue and ask about the previous issue the customer
faced.&nbsp; It will up the customer
satisfaction level.&nbsp; </p>



<h4>Conclusion: </h4>



<p>Human agents were, are, and will be occupying the central position of the customer service industry.  The chance of AI replacing live agents looks very slim in the near future as AI needs a lot of improvement to be at par with a human agent in terms of emotional intelligence. </p>

<p>In this competitive age, good customer
experience holds the key to customer loyalty.&nbsp;
In order to provide a good experience, businesses must focus on
delivering exceptional customer support that meets, if not overcomes your
customer’s expectations. </p>



<p>Customers today are exposed to the gold
standard of customer service. They are aware of their options and the power
they have. Therefore, they have high expectations from a business.</p>



<h2>So, What Does Your Customer Want?</h2>



<p>They want a company to promptly respond to
their queries and issues via the channel of their choice.&nbsp; If they wish to change the communication
channel, they should be able to do so seamlessly without having to repeat
themselves. </p>



<p>Today most of the companies provide customer support via a number of channels including <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/voice.html">voice</a>, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">chat</a>, email, social media, instant messaging, web, and mobile. However, the challenge is to integrate those channels for providing seamless interaction with consistent experience at multiple touch-points across the life cycle of a customer.  Such a feat is only achievable by adopting an omnichannel approach. </p>



<p>Fusion advocates <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="omnichannel customer support (opens in a new tab)">omnichannel customer support</a> to provide customers with a cohesive and integrated customer experience irrespective of where and how a customer chooses to reach you. Omnichannel customer support brings you a number of benefits. Here are the top benefits of adopting omnichannel customer support.</p>



<h2>Benefits of Omnichannel Customer Support &#8211;</h2>



<h3>1. Gain Greater Customer Insights</h3>



<p>Customer support channels such as chat, social media, forums, and emails, leave a recorded written customer trace. You can use this data to accumulate customer information in its context. It will help you better understand how the customers choose to interact with your brand and their needs across all channels.</p>



<p>Having this data in one place will enable you to take proactive actions and create effective strategies to tweak and enhance your customer support and deliver better customer experience.</p>



<h3>2. Serve Your Customers Where They Are</h3>



<p>Customers today want to make purchases on their own terms, at their convenience, and in a way that suits them the best. To build a sustainable business, you must satisfy your customers. That means you have to appeal to them wherever they are.</p>



<p>No matter what channel they choose to interact with you, you must provide seamless, cohesive support via the same. If the customer wishes to change their channel, they should be able to continue with the conversation across the channel as well.</p>



<p>Customers today are more powerful and aware
of the options they have. Therefore, they expect more from brands.&nbsp; They expect to get the best experience
wherever they are — whether online or offline. Providing it to them will not
only improve your conversion rate but will also increase a customer’s loyalty.</p>



<h3>3. Enhance the Shopping Experience Everywhere</h3>



<p>Your customer can choose to shop online,
in-app, or in a brick and mortar store, and still expect the same level of
customer experience. </p>



<p>For example – a customer looks for a product he has seen online at a brick and mortar store and the in-store representative finds the product out of stock.  He can then place an order for the same in their e-commerce store, to be delivered at the customer&#8217;s doorstep. </p>



<p>This way, omnichannel customer support can
enhance the shopping experience.</p>



<h3>4. Enhance Real-time Customer Support</h3>



<p>As customers’ demands are increasing by the day, businesses are making efforts to meet them. Customers want their needs to be met and they want it now. If you cannot deliver a real-time answer to their questions, or provide instant support, you are indirectly asking them to leave.</p>



<p>Real-time customer support boost customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. With <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-omnichannel-customer-service-best-practices-to-boost-customer-experience.html">omnichannel customer support</a>, it is possible to offer real-time support across a number of channels, creating a seamless customer experience.</p>



<h3>5. Happier, More Engaged and Loyal Customer</h3>



<p>When you have omnichannel customer support in place, your customers will be able to switch between channels seamlessly without feeling the frustration of having to repeat the issues. Also having up-to-date data in one place means faster resolution of issues. Such things definitely add to customer satisfaction rate and result in happier customers. Everyone knows that a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/start-by-keeping-your-customers-happy.html">happy customer</a> is the greatest thing for a business.</p>



<p>These are the vital benefits of adopting an omnichannel approach when it comes to customer service.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Customer experience is the need of the hour. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-quick-tips-can-improve-your-customer-experience-instantly.html">Great customer experience can make your customers happy</a> and happy customers result in more business.  That is why more and more businesses these days are trying to provide their customers with state-of-the-art customer service. </p>



<p>Today when the customers expect nothing but the best
treatment from the company, the standard customer service cannot offer the same
level of satisfaction. For that, you need to shift from reactive to proactive
customer service.&nbsp; </p>



<h2>What is Reactive and Proactive Customer Service?</h2>



<p>Reactive customer service is when a customer has a question
while browsing your website, contacts you via different communication channels
and waits for a response. This is the standard customer service that most companies
provide. </p>



<p>Proactive customer service means anticipating customer
issues and addressing them proactively through a number of communication
channels (including forums, FAQs, knowledge base, and instructional videos).
Reaching out to your customers to inform them about a problem before they have
experienced it is an example of proactive customer service. Proactive customer
service has the power to get your customers live for your brand.</p>



<h2>Why is Proactive Support Important?</h2>



<p>Proactive customer support offers a number of benefits for
your business. These are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increase
customer loyalty</strong> – According to a report by <a href="https://medium.com/@Workato/what-role-will-ai-play-in-the-future-of-customer-service-7332a7e503b7">Enkata</a>
taking initiative in your support can boost customer retention rates by 3-5%.</li><li><strong>Decrease
support calls</strong> – Being proactive can help your business identify issues and
resolve them before they turn into problems, and thus can reduce the number of
tickets you receive.</li><li><strong>Take
charge of communication</strong> – By being proactive you can get involved in what
your customers are saying about your brand in private and on social media.&nbsp; You will also get a chance to engage with
them in a way that puts your business in a favorable light.</li><li><strong>Acquire
new customers</strong> &#8211; By being proactive you will get the opportunities to reach
out to prospective customers, and encourage them to switch to your brand.</li><li><strong>Retain
existing customers</strong> &#8211; When you proactively reach out to your customers, even
when they haven’t mentioned you directly, it deepens the relationship. With
social media customer service on the rage, you will need to go that extra mile
to exceed their expectations of good customer service. </li><li><strong>Create brand
advocates</strong> &#8211; Proactive customer service offers the chance to turn your
customers into brand advocates. &nbsp;Studies
show that a happy customer will tell at least 3 people about their experience.</li><li><strong>Protection
against escalation</strong> &#8211; You can avoid a social crisis by early identification
negativity surrounding your brand. </li></ul>



<p>This shows that proactive is the way to go for customer service.  While reactive customer service will cover your base, proactive customer service will take customer satisfaction and loyalty to a whole new level. According to a study by inContact, consumers were generally positive with proactive service. In fact, 87% of adults surveyed are happy to be contacted proactively by different companies regarding customer service issues. </p>



<h2>So How to Introduce Proactive Customer Service in Your Business? </h2>



<p>Here are a few easy tips:</p>



<h4>1. Ask for Feedback</h4>



<p>Customer service is about giving customers what they want. So, the first thing you have to do is to find out what they want. And the best way to do so is by asking them. If you check on your customers regularly, you may identify your weakness and correct them before your customers start to resent it. </p>



<h4>2. Announce Your Mistakes Before Customers Find Out</h4>



<p>Have you identified a problem in your product, service or
operations? It is better than your customers hear about it directly from you
instead of finding out themselves. Admitting your mistake, apologizing, fixing
the issue quickly, and/or offering a discount to compensate for their
inconvenience can help you earn your customer’s trust, avoid bad PR, and ensure
that the customers do not go anywhere.&nbsp; </p>



<h4>3. Reward Customer Loyalty </h4>



<p>Offering rewards for regular business is a good
loyalty-building tool. Loyalty programs demonstrate your company’s desire to
reward a customer as a token of thanks. You can proactively reach out to
customers with offers in between purchases. This can be a chance for positive
interaction with customers that strengthens their relationship with your
company. For example – you can send a discount voucher to your customers a
month before their subscription with you ends, compelling them to renew the
subscription. </p>



<h4>3. Pay Attention to What Your Customers Are Saying Online</h4>



<p>Pay close attention to what your customers are saying about
your brand online. If you reach out to customers who mentioned your brand in
their post, whether in a good context or bad, you will be able to address their
needs preemptively and increase their customer satisfaction.</p>



<h4>4. Create A Knowledge Base for Common Questions</h4>



<p>If you look carefully, you will find a set of common
questions that your customers frequently ask your customer support team or
search online. If you create a knowledge base where the answers to these
questions are provided, it will help your customers easily get their answers
without calling your customer service department. It will save time and bring
down the number of support calls. </p>



<h4>5. Introduce Live Chat</h4>



<p>Having a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="live chat (opens in a new tab)">live chat</a> on your website helps your customers resolve their queries while browsing your site. According to some, the ability to get answers from a live chat representative during an online purchase is among the most important features a business can offer. Proactively asking your customers if they need help through live chat can result in more business.</p>



<p>These are a few tips that can help your business adopt proactive customer service practices.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While voice remains the number one channel for interaction
between business and its customers, the new age customers today are more
inclined to solve the basic customer service issues by themselves.&nbsp; And for that reason, businesses today are
adding self-service to their customer service channels. Self-service can not
only help customers to save time but also can help businesses boost customer
experience and drive customer loyalty. </p>



<p>These are five types of customer self-service a business can
introduce to boost your customer experience.</p>



<h3>1. Customer Self-service Portals</h3>



<p>If you have customers around the clock, you must have a team
of customer service representatives who can give support 24/7 support around
the world. If you do not have such facility and operate limited hours, a large
section of your customers will have a hard time reaching you. Also, the younger
tech-savvy crowd will definitely look for their answers online even before
reaching your customer service.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Rather than leaving your customer without support from your end, you can invest in a customer self-service portal that contains answers to the most common queries, instruction for basic fixes and a few others that a customer can easily resolve.</p>



<p>Using this portal, a customer can get answers to their basic queries and explore the knowledge base for further details during the non-operational hours. This also allows them to bypass the calling queue and get their answer from your end at their own time and pace. </p>



<p>An additional perk?&nbsp;
The self-service portal can significantly decrease your customer service
costs!</p>



<h3>2. Mobile</h3>



<p>Today most people browse the internet from their smartphone.
Scratch that, people today do almost everything on their smartphone – it’s
easy, it’s convenient and a powerful tool that fits in your pocket.</p>



<p>A mobile app or mobile version of your site can prove to be
beneficial as a self-service tool. However, make sure to make the mobile
version of site user-friendly so that your customers can easily navigate
through the site to find the answers they are looking for.</p>



<p>You can also build a user-friendly app that offers push
notifications and updated features that help you keep the customers updated
about the company and its service updates.</p>



<h3>3. Chatbots and AI</h3>



<p>Live chatbots can offer a great customer experience. With
the help of AI, chatbots can answer customer queries in a matter of seconds.
chatbots can help customers by answering their queries, assisting them, and
even helping them with booking and sales. With live chatbots, finding answers to
your queries have become easier than ever. </p>



<p>Live chatbots are a great way to help confused customers.
Many company sites offer a popup chat window that appears after a certain
period of time spent on the website. These bots have the capability to guide
the customer to the answers they are looking for. Even when they do not have
answers, they can point the customers in the right direction. These chatbots
are also a great way to show that your company cares for its customers and CX.</p>



<h3>4. Kiosks</h3>



<p>A kiosk can be good for short, specific tasks, such as
finding an item in a physical store or checking the price. Self-checkout kiosks
can also help a customer with checkout and payment.</p>



<h3>5. Functional Automated Phone Systems</h3>



<p>While the phone remains the preferred business interaction
channel for a large section of customers, the younger generation sees it as the
last resort. You can find a middle ground and offer them the option to speak to
a representative or resolve the issue following an automated menu system and accomplish
the task quickly without needing an agent. </p>



<p>These five types of self-service can help your customers to
quickly find the answer to their queries without needing an agent and boost
their customer experience as well.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Businesses talk about quality customer experience. But are they really practicing what they preach? Let us look at the data:</p>



<p>According to Forrester&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/The+US+Customer+Experience+Index+2016/-/E-RES131003">2016 U.S. Customer Experience (CX) Index Report</a>, <em>consumers said that only 1 percent of U.S. businesses deliver excellent customer service</em>. The same research found that the state of customer experience stayed stagnant among Canadian businesses, and none of the U.K. companies received a top-rated score.</p>



<p>Clearly, with everyone talking about customer experience,
such a scenario was not expected. It clearly shows that most businesses are
either clueless about customer experience or are too lazy to go that extra mile
to give their customers a state-of-the-art experience. </p>



<p>Either way, it seems that the businesses have a lot to learn to improve customer experience. It will take many big and small changes to reach that place where they can <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/engage-your-agents-xfactor-quality-customer-experience.html">deliver top-class customer experience</a>. Here are a few quick-fixes that can help businesses improve their customer service in an instance.</p>



<h3>1. Say thank you to a power user</h3>



<p>Strengthening your relationship with your power users
sometimes means going offline. Take the time to understand how your product
fits into your customer’s life, recognizing them and appreciating their
business in a uniquely meaningful way will make them feel special.</p>



<h3>2. Personalize </h3>



<p>It has been a trend for many pizza shops to draw a picture
on the pizza box on personal request. Other businesses can take a lesson from
them and start entertaining personal requests on their packaging. While it
takes an extra minute or two, such personalization sends a clear message to
customers that they are seen and heard and that their decision to give you
their business is appreciated by you. </p>



<p>For example – you can ask for your customer’s choice about
how he wants to be addressed the first time he calls and use the same address
every single time. This is particularly important during the trial period.
Taking the time to connect with your customer on a personal level builds a bond
between the customer and the brand that the customer will remember when the
trial is over.</p>



<h3>3. Give away free stuff</h3>



<p>One of the surest ways to make customers happy is to give
them free stuff. But there is a difference between giving away useless stuff
and providing customers with added bonuses that add value to their life or to
their business. And do not forget to personalize the stuff. You see, not
everyone will find the same thing interesting.</p>



<p>Therefore, you should use a web personalization strategy to
help you determine the type of free offering you should offer to different
customer segments.</p>



<h3>4. Fix problems before they occur</h3>



<p>One way of creating outstanding customer experiences and
making customers happy is to solve your customer’s problems before they realize
they exist.</p>



<p>The idea is to stay one step ahead of the customer. It will
give you chance to solve problems proactively and create a flawless customer
experience. It also offers you ample scope of planning your customer outreach
and personalizing it.</p>



<h3>5. Fix your ineffective signup form</h3>



<p>Sign up forms are often among the first things you see when
visiting a product page for the first time. A lengthy form can send potential
customers back before you get the chance to explain what your product does.</p>



<p>Take time to re-evaluate your forms with the help of new and
existing users. Ideally, you should include their feedback to create a more
professional, comfortable experience. 

You can incorporate a few of these tips in your
customer experience to improve its quality instantly.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Customers today are exposed to the gold standard of customer service and hence expect nothing but the best experience from a business. Therefore, providing <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/services.html">outstanding customer service</a> round the clock in a call center environment has become a must for every business. It helps you stay ahead of your competition, retain your customers, and even win over new customers. But there’s a secret ingredient in this recipe for success that distinguishes the greats from the ordinary. And that is – personalized customer service. </p>



<p>&nbsp;By personalizing
customer service, you start treating people as people and not as just a
customer. A little personalization can go a long way empowering your customers
and lead to customer loyalty, confident agents, higher sales, and better
competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Wondering how to add personalization to your call center
customer service? Here are a few tips:</p>



<h3>1. Use Automation</h3>



<p><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/will-ai-replace-or-enhance-a-call-center.html">Automation can be a great tool to personalize customer service</a>. Automation can help your agents save time to provide one-on-one care to customers who need that. Automation or AI can be used to:</p>



<ul><li>route customers to the right department
intelligently</li><li>collect necessary data before starting a voice
interaction</li><li>Share real-time information between agents or
teams</li></ul>



<p>Chatbots, CRM integrations, scripts, and other automation
tools can help make the lives of customer service agents a lot easier.</p>



<h3>2. Create full customer profiles</h3>



<p>Creating profiles of your customer groups will help you understand your customers better. You will be able to see their motivations in a customer service environment and make informed decisions. You will be able to take a look at your customer data from the marketing team to understand your customer demographic and develop accurate profiles with personalized information.</p>



<p>These profiles will help you offer more personalized service to your customers. And the personalized the care, the greater is the chance of customer satisfaction.</p>



<h3>3. Use optimized scripts</h3>



<p>At first glance, script and personalized customer service do
not seem to gel well. But scripts can truly be the key to delivering a
high-quality personalized customer experience. Using a call center scripting
software, you can now customize and deploy script. While features like CRM
integration and others help your agents and customers get what they need in one
place.&nbsp; </p>



<p>An integrated call script can help agents big time. They can simply follow a guided session that links to their preferred CRM and deliver personalized customer service. They can provide feedback on the efficacy of a particular script and can even improve on that.</p>



<p>This way, you can get a tested, observed and approved a script that can satisfy your customer, increase the efficiency of your agents, drive brand loyalty and positive conversion. That is the reason Fusion believes, a high performing script is a key to success.</p>



<h3>4. Offer Multichannel and Self-service support options</h3>



<p>Personalized customer service is all about empowering your
customers and valuing their choices. Not every customer is comfortable with the
same communication channels and therefore you should provide them solutions
through the communication channel of their choice.</p>



<p>Offering <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-omnichannel-customer-service-best-practices-to-boost-customer-experience.html">multichannel service</a> for finding solutions, answering queries, troubleshooting, and contacting the right team sends your customer the message that you are rooting for them. Offering self-service is personalization at its best. Here are a few communication channels that you can provide service through:&nbsp; </p>



<ul><li>phone</li><li><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/looking-to-improve-email-customer-support-heres-how-we-do-it.html">email </a></li><li><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/how-to-provide-good-live-chat-support-to-your-customers.html">live chat</a></li><li><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/12-tips-for-enhanced-customer-service-through-social-media.html">social media</a></li><li>self-service support options</li></ul>



<p>With consumers preferring self-service support, you should
start offering a personalized self-service option that helps customers quickly
and easily find the answer they need. It makes the customers happy and takes
the stress away from your call center and sales team.</p>



<h3>5. Be a Human</h3>



<p>&nbsp;In order to win your
customers being a human is as important as personalization.&nbsp; Your customers should never feel like they
are talking to robots, even if they initially interacted with one.&nbsp; Personalized customer service training must
involve ways of responding like a human, dealing with emotions, and working
through different customer scenarios. Training your agents to deal with all
these will go a long way in creating a personalized and productive customer
experience. </p>



<p>While providing your customers with a seamless personalized
service experience involves many factors, it is not very difficult to achieve.
You just have to know your customers and meet their needs with different
customer support tools and automation. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While we read a lot about how to provide <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/provide-quality-customer-service-to-the-millennials.html">quality
customer experience to the millennials</a> through business interactions,
little has been said about improving customer experience of the elderly. When
you have an elderly customer at the other end of the line, you should treat
them very differently from the way you deal with your millennial customers. </p>



<p>Dealing with an elderly customer comes with its own unique
challenges. You cannot deal with them the way you can deal with millennials and
middle-aged.&nbsp; The reasons behind this
are-</p>



<ul><li>Most of them are not that tech-savvy</li><li>Health deterioration has led to hearing loss and
memory loss among the elderly</li><li>They have a hard time remembering things and
therefore keeps repeating themselves.</li><li>They communicate slower</li><li>They do not like being patronized</li></ul>



<p>Elderly people often find it hard to understand the basics
of modern technology like fixing the simplest computer issue or resolving a
billing problem. Therefore, a customer service agent needs to give extra
attention while attending their calls.</p>



<p>Here are some suggestions for making the interaction go smoothly.</p>



<h3>1. Treat Them with Respect</h3>



<p>Seniors often feel like they are being patronized or belittled by young agents even when it is not so.&nbsp; Therefore, an agent needs to be extra cautious about while talking to them. Instead of talking down to elderly customers, the agent must recognize their wisdom and treat them with respect.</p>



<p>If it’s taking longer to reach a solution due to their slower communication, an agent must not let frustration show. Working with them in a non-condescending tone often achieves much better results.</p>



<h3>2. Write It Down</h3>



<p>Deafness and forgetfulness are often the most common
elements that comes with age and they make getting the message across a
challenge.&nbsp; Therefore, writing down the
information on a notepad or email can make the whole process a lot easier and
help them in a better way.</p>



<h3>3. Give Coupons</h3>



<p>Recognizing the economic standing of the senior customers is
the first step of forging a lasting relationship with your senior customers. Living
off their retirement funds, seniors can benefit from special discounts and
coupons. If you can provide them with special discounts whenever possible, it
will create a good relationship between you and your elderly customers who will
get a strong sense of customer experience. </p>



<h3>4. Patience is Virtue</h3>



<p>Seniors often take longer to make a decision, understand a
request, and respond. But that is no excuse for agents to show their annoyance
or frustration. On the contrary, patience is the key here. Agents need to
slowdown, listen, and gather all information. And once they do that, dealing
with senior customers gets a lot easier.</p>



<h3>5. Maintain a Cheerful and Helpful Attitude</h3>



<p>While the millennials prefer self-help tools, senior
customers are still mostly old-school – they prefer talking to a live agent,
either face-to-face or over the phone. Therefore, agents taking the calls
should maintain a cheerful and helpful attitude to give the senior customers a
good customer service experience.</p>



<h3>6. Lend an Ear</h3>



<p>Many of the elderly customers are lonely and do not even have someone to talk to.&nbsp; Therefore, they ted to talk more even while discussing business with a live human agent. Sharing stories or talking excessively makes them feel better and listening to them goes a long way to create a pleasant experience for them. So, do not cut them off while they are sharing their stories. It will help you resolve the problem and provide them with outstanding customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>While it is not guaranteed that all the elderly customers will have a great customer experience even when you follow the tips mentioned above, but these tips will definitely help you improve their experience and earn their loyalty.  </p>

<p>Social customer service is an important tool to build
customer experience, drive loyalty, enhance brand reputation and lower
operational expenses by reducing the volume of customer service calls.&nbsp; However, in order to successfully cater to
your customers through social customer service you need to offer quick response
and resolution. </p>



<p>Exposed to the gold standard of customer service, consumers
today want answers to their queries and resolutions to their issues and they
want it right now. They do not have time to wait for a day to get a response of
an email or to wait in an IVR queue to talk to another human. In such
situations social customer support can come to the company’s rescue.&nbsp; When done rightly the personal, knowledgeable
and helpful nature of social customer service can not only resolve customer
issues pronto but can also drive better customer experience and boost brand
reputation.</p>



<p>But the question is, how can a brand with limited resources,
small teams, and isolated departments (CRM, helpdesk, customer support, and
social) deliver faster and more effective customer care interactions via social
media? Here are a few tips:</p>



<h3>1. Show the human face of your company</h3>



<p>Your customers prefer interacting with other people, not
automated systems. Social customer care agents can quickly connect with
consumers on a personal level by showing empathy for the consumer and their
issues.&nbsp; And thus, they create the opportunity
to diagnose an issue further, leading to quicker resolution. This also improves
your brand perception.</p>



<h3>2. Acknowledge pronto</h3>



<p>It is possible that a social customer care agent may not
have all the answers or that resolving the issue requires the customer to be
redirected to another department or channel (for due to personally identifiable
information requirements or other sensitive information), the agent must let
the customer know that they are on the care and the brand cares for its
customers. Customers today are willing to wait a little if the company
acknowledges their requests or issues. </p>



<p>In case an issue cannot be resolved right away, the agents
should provide the customer with a timeframe and stick to it. A little delay
here and there is okay but do not go a whole day past the deadline to provide a
response.&nbsp; This way your company can lose
their precious goodwill.</p>



<h3>3. Don’t compel customer to change the channel unless absolutely necessary</h3>



<p>Customers today prefer to get a response to their issue in
the same channel through which they interacted with the company regarding the
issue.&nbsp; While there are times when
conversations need to be taken offline, businesses should attempt to respond to
issues publicly through the same channel where the inquiry is made. Pushing your
customers from one channel to another is never a good idea. This leads to
confusion and frustration and increases the resolution time significantly.</p>



<h3>4. Clearly mention operating hours</h3>



<p>If you can’t provide 24-hour social care support, have the information clearly listed across all channels. Better still <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com">hire a BPO for managing your social customer care</a> during the non-operational hours.  If that is not an option for you, make sure to list other communication channels of your brand, as well as links to other useful information, FAQs, easy-fix videos, and much more.</p>



<h3>5. Get the right for the right job</h3>



<p>Your social care team should be armed with the right tools
and training, and tested against any type of scenarios. You can either integrate
social experts into the traditional call center or transition and train members
of the call center for social response. Availing the social customer care
services from a reputed BPO can also be a solution. However, be sure to have a
tight integration between your inhouse customer service team and the outsourced
ones. This will help you identify mass issues quickly by addressing your
customers through proactive posts and messages across all communication
channels. It will also reduce the response time and volume of inquiries through
social and traditional channels. </p>



<h3>6. FAQs and pre-approved information</h3>



<p>If you analyze the queries carefully, you can always find a
list of questions that are repeated time and again across all channels. You can
easily develop a list of these FAQs with their responses, get it approved and
keep it stored in a content library for quick distribution. This will help you
in reducing the social care response time and costs and improve the efficacy of
your social care team.</p>



<h3>7. Know the Customers</h3>



<p>Knowing your customers and understanding their value to your
company can help you prioritize responses and decide the way some individual
cases are handled. A customer with a wide social footprint, or a brand advocate
with deep knowledge about your product should get a priority treatment.&nbsp; Therefore, social care agents must look for
social profile information of a customer before responding. </p>



<p>However, you must also know the time when most of your
customers are active on social media and manage your workforces accordingly to
provide quick and efficient resolutions to all your customers. The response
provided to all customers should be prompts, personalized with thoughtful in
order to increase their satisfaction level.</p>



<h3>8. Get Right Tools</h3>



<p>You need to have the right tools and technology in place for more effective and efficient care. With the use of monitoring, categorization, filtering and automated routing, together with approval workflows and measurement as well as reporting capabilities social care efforts can be speeded up and improved.</p>



<p>Like all customer service channels social customer service too needs to be managed quickly and thoughtfully. If you do not speed up the response times, or leave questions unanswered your customers will feel devalued and frustrated and will vent their annoyance in public. Therefore, bad social customer service is worse than having no social customer service at all. </p>
