								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Live answering service call centers usually have a team of talented copywriters who design a call controlling script for the agents at the centers to follow. Agents are trained to follow the script so that they do not make mistakes and do not forget instructing or telling customers about something that they must know. However, when agents are naturally conversing with customers having the call controlling script just as a guide, they deliver better customer satisfaction levels.</p>
<p>Often agents at a telephone answering service may seem to be very dumb as these agents seem to read directly from the scripts without actually caring about and understanding what the customers have to say. Just merely reading from scripts will make <strong><a title="live answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">live answering service</a></strong> agents sound highly mechanical and like complete idiots. The customers might not be interested in paying attention to what these ‘robots’ have to say.</p>
<p>The agents that the customers are speaking o are expected to have high levels of intelligence, common sense and even traits of human emotion. Over scripting is not a good thing in telephone answering service call centers; often agents forget that the script is just a guide and they follow it word for word. The agents are trained to render a personal touch to the conversations so that the customers may be interested in talking to them without hanging up. It is better if the agents take the name of the customers and refer to them while talking.</p>
<p>If customers would want to hear robots, they would not have opted to talk to live agents, so agents must behave like real persons.</p>

It is to be noted that all IVR systems have three kinds of cost components that must be considered apart from the upgrading costs and the general maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The first IVR cost component that is considered usually by <strong><a title="phone answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">phone answering service</a></strong> call centers is the cost of CTI hardware and the computer systems. This is a fixed as well as one-time cost, and the call answering service will not have to invest in it unless certain amount of capacity enhancement is required in future.</p>
<p>The second component is the cost involved in customized voice application. The IVR call flow implementation costs can also include integration with third party applications such as web services and customer relationship management (CRM). The call centers must either invest in in-house qualified man power or can get the voice application tool developed from the IVR software providers.</p>
<p>The third component is the telephone cost; the costs can be charged on per call per minute basis as per the convenience of the businesses and organizations. When human agents interact with the IVR callers in the phone answering service call centers, the call transfer cost gets very high in the long run. This is dependent on the call volume.</p>
<p>After the center decides what they need, on premise IVR system or hosted IVR, they can think about the cost components and deploy the right IVR system for the center.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Call back feature is used in the live answering service call centers when callers call the numbers and then disconnects without waiting for a respondent to answer the call. The live answering service agents are required to dial the number back from where the missed call was made and get in touch with the person.</p>
<p>The call back feature is implemented through smart IVR that performs different tasks. The caller ID must be detected first and foremost by the <strong><a title="call answering services" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">call answering service</a></strong> and also looked up in a database to find out if the caller ID is registered for a call back service. In case, the caller ID that is detected is found to be a registered user for the call back service, an outbound call must be made to the number.</p>
<p>Once the caller ID takes the call, there must be a prompt for entering the phone number. The IVR system now makes another outbound call to the phone number that is entered at the prompt and then gets it bridged with the previous call.</p>
<p>The call back feature is a great tool for lowering the call costs and also effective when the phone answering service does not want the subscribers to make the support calls. This can be a substitute for the toll free numbers; when customers dial toll free numbers, they are not charged for the calls, but the call center has to pay per minute charges for the call. Thus, usage of IVR is a cost effective option for the call centers.</p>

For making IVR user-friendly, the phone answering service call centers have to focus on scripting menus, categorizing the complex menus into simpler sub-menus, as well as scripting phrases that are used for offering information.</p>
<p>In case of scripting, the menu options must be clearly scripted and accuracy of options is a must. The options must be appropriate so that callers can understand all options clearly. When dividing the complex or large options in IVR systems, live answering service firms either group options or categorizes options in two-level menus instead of having one. This assists the first time callers of businesses in using the IVR system and makes the entire process a smooth affair. This kind of division also makes the process much faster and saves time for the callers.</p>
<p>The phrases must also be scripted tactfully; the phrases are usually written by professional team of writers at the <strong><a title="live answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">live answering service</a></strong> call centers; these phrases are likely to be recorded or may be used with TTS. When proper scripts are absent at the call centers, the IVR might not be usable even by experts at handling IVR systems. The technology will be a total waste without proper script writing for it.</p>
