<p>You have been told that proactive chat is a great way to up the customer satisfaction level. However, proactive chats too can ruin otherwise good customer experience.</p>



<p>Here’s an example – while browsing a site the live chat agent starts an interaction with you stating its various products and features that are already given on the webpage and do not give you a chance to convey what you are looking for. How would you feel then? </p>



<p>It is natural to get annoyed at such behavior. Proactive chat
only enhances the customer experience when it is used the way it is supposed
to.&nbsp; Your agents must know what works the
best and what does not.&nbsp; To save you the
time, Fusion brings you the best tips and tricks to turn a bad online
experience into a winning one.</p>



<h2>1. Leverage analytics to find the right time</h2>



<p>The key to <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">providing quality customer service through proactive chat</a> is using the analytics to your benefit. You can use analytics to determine many factors like:</p>



<ul><li>Average browsing time of a visitor.</li><li>His/her behavior for every page of the website.</li></ul>



<p>Based on the information gathered through analytics, you can
decide the appropriate wait time for sending out a proactive message.</p>



<h2>2. Track referring URLs</h2>



<p>In the present age, your work does not end after placing promotional links at different places online, you need to also keep track of its aftermath.  Tracking referring URLs can create great conversion opportunities. You must identify the users who came to your website through the referral links and send out proactive chat invitations to them.</p>



<p>In case they came to your site grab some promotional offers featured on the referring website, a proactive chat is the best way to direct them to the offer page. Proactive chat can also be used to resolve any other query they might have regarding the offer. </p>



<h2>3. Provide 24/7 customer support</h2>



<p>Customers these days expect instant query resolution. Moreover, they expect round the clock support 365 days a year from you.  You must be there to guide/assist them at any point of the day.  And that means having some proven customer touch points on a 24/7 basis.  These touch points include email, VOIP channels, social media platforms, live chat and more.</p>



<p>In this situation, proactive chat can be your best option &#8211; it helps help you to know your potential customers and their queries before they approach you and provide the most satisfactory solution. </p>



<h2>4. Use proactive chat tools for smarter communications</h2>



<p>As visual learners, your customers will learn better when you
explain you explain facts about your products and services through demos. You
can use this to your advantage and employ tools like live voice chat, live
video chat to educate them.&nbsp; You can also
redirect your customers to relevant pages using co-browsing or proactively
offer them links to support videos through chat.</p>



<p>These tips can help you improve your lackluster proactive chat
support into an effective tool to improve customer satisfaction. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With customers today exposed the gold standard of customer service, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-quick-tips-can-improve-your-customer-experience-instantly.html">great customer experience</a> has become the need of the hour for businesses. You need to deliver nothing short of 5-star customer experience through every channel every single time.  </p>



<p><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">Live chat</a> has come across as an excellent customer interaction channel through which it is possible to deliver great customer experience. Want to know how? Here are nine easy steps to achieve excellence in customer experience:</p>



<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Make the Chat button visible</h3>



<p>Make sure that your customers can find that chat or contact
button easily on your website. If the customer has to look for it, it does not
amount to great customer experience. Setting up an automated and customized
message that engage your audience is a great way to get noticed. A prominent
and colorful chat now button will do the trick too.</p>



<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Don’t let the customer wait</h3>



<p>Once the chat starts do not let your customers wait for an
answer. The point of having a chat is not having to wait in a queue. Have your
live chat agents talk to a few visitors at a time. This way you will always
have somebody ready to chat.</p>



<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Personalize</h3>



<p>Personalizing results in great experience. You can use live
chat software that integrates with CRM to gather information about the customer
including their location, chat history, etc. The information will give you an
insight into the customer. You can also find important insight about the
customer from the notes made by you and your colleagues.</p>



<h3>Step 4 &#8211; Lend an Ear</h3>



<p>While chatting with a customer, live chat agents should be
more precise when providing solutions, as they have customers’ questions and
needs written in front of them. Listening to their problems first will help you
find a precise solution a lot quicker.</p>



<h3>Step 5 &#8211; Let the customer know if you need more time</h3>



<p>There will be times when a ready solution is not available.
So when you feel the need for some research or expert advice, communicate the
same to your customer. Give them a time frame and get back to the customer
within the timeframe. </p>



<h3>Step 6 &#8211; Take it easy on canned responses</h3>



<p>Use simple and clear language while talking with customers.
Having a personality while interacting via live chat will help you provide a
great experience to your customers. It is better to not use too many canned
responses. Use them only when you need to speed up the interaction while not
compromising with customer satisfaction.</p>



<h3>Step 7 &#8211; Empathy is everything</h3>



<p>Empathy is a must-have skill for everyone who wants to work
in customer support. Without the ability to imagine what the customers go
through and how does it make them feel, your reactions won’t be genuine.&nbsp; Knowing the situation, the customer is in
will help you find the solution fast.</p>



<h3>Step 8 &#8211; End a chat on a positive note</h3>



<p>You have probably heard the phrase – “<em>All’s well that ends well</em>”. It is true for your live chat interactions as well. The way you finish your interaction will have a lasting impression. If handled poorly, it can create a bitter memory for the customer. Ask customers if they’re satisfied with the solution you provided or whether there’s any part of the conversation that they didn’t understand and need further explanation.</p>



<p>Also, you need to ask if there’s anything else that they
need help with. You can end the chat with an intention to hear from them.
Saying this will remind them that you are there for them<strong>.</strong></p>



<h3>Step 9 &#8211; Follow up with a customer</h3>



<p>Do not forget to send a follow up to a customer -it is the best way to finish an amazing customer service. You can use email for the follow-up and ask if everything is working the way they should.</p>



<p>This way you can provide your customers with a great customer experience via live chat. </p>

<p>Even when people know what they are looking for while
shopping, they still may need some assistance for locating them in a
store.&nbsp; And it is not only brick and
mortar store we are talking about, people need ready assistance while online
shopping as well. </p>



<p>According to a study conducted by <a href="http://www.roosit.nl/files/en/documents/Forrester_making_proactive_chat_work.pdf">Forrester Research</a>, 44% of online consumers say that having questions answered by a live person while in the middle of an online purchase is one of the most important features a website can offer.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chat_work.png" alt="Customer Experience Online Survey" class="wp-image-6416" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chat_work.png 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chat_work-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption><em> Live Help Is One Of The Most Important Features A Site Can Offer To US Online Consumers</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>While waiting on a call queue is something customers are not
fond of, communicating with your customer support team via Live chat is
something customers find convenient. It offers your customers a solution to
resolve their queries at the right time without having to leave the page they
are currently viewing.</p>



<p>An advance live chat facility can help you boost your customer experience and drive more sales. The process can also be outsourced easily without hampering the quality of customer experience. A <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/live-chat-support-benefits-every-business.html">quality live chat support</a> must have the following features.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Screen
sharing:</strong> With screen sharing the agent gets temporary access to a
customer’s computer screen and he can navigate on behalf of the customer. It is
easier and simpler way to assist the customer in situations where the customer
is not tech-savvy.</li><li><strong>Co-browsing:</strong>
When the customer is having difficulty placing an order online, the agents can
show how to use the ordering pages with the help of Co-browsing.</li><li><strong>Instant
Messaging:</strong> Instant messaging will help a customer get prompt answer to
their queries, speeding the purchasing process.</li><li><strong>Video
Conferencing:</strong> video conferencing can help you serve a priority customer
better. It calls for better customer experience and more personalized support.</li><li><strong>Calling
Facilities:</strong> Having a calling facility in the live chat support can provide
your customer an opportunity to talk to a live agent making the experience
better.</li></ul>



<p>However, rich features alone cannot create a great chat
support experience for the customers.&nbsp;
For that you need to follow a few live chat best practices.&nbsp; Want to know about them? Check them out:</p>



<h3>1. Make the Most out
of Canned Messages</h3>



<p>By using canned messages, customer service agents can greet
customers fast without having to type it all.</p>



<h3>2. Collect
Information</h3>



<p>Use pre-chat surveys to know the issues your customers have
before they begin typing. Set a routing rule based on this information so that
the chat goes to the right department or agent.</p>



<h3>3. Practice Using
Shortcuts</h3>



<p>Setting shortcut keys for frequently used operations, like
canned responses will help your agents save time. Fusion has successfully used
canned response for its live chat support services and significantly reduced
the Average Handling Time (AHT). </p>



<h3>4. Use Alternate
Media</h3>



<p>You can also save time by sending images, files,
screenshots, or even how-to videos to customers instead of writing complex
responses.</p>



<h3>5. Be clear about Wait Time and Operation Hours</h3>



<p>If an issue cannot be resolved immediately, tell the
customer that and give them a clear wait time and stick to it. Also, if the
live chat support is available 24/7 say so, if not then mention that too. Your
website, social media profile should also have the operational hours mentioned
clearly.</p>



<h3>6. Personalize Your Chat</h3>



<p>Personalize your greeting and responses using the customer’s
name and buyer history. It is a great way to let your customers know that you
care about their unique issue. </p>



<h3>7. Build a Connection</h3>



<p>Use customer service representative names and photos to
build a rapport between your customer and the customer service representatives
at the beginning of the interaction.</p>



<h3>8. Acknowledge and
Empathize</h3>



<p>Being sensitive to your customers’ needs, acknowledging
their concerns makes the customers feel that your care for them and are not
trying to wrap it up quickly.</p>



<h3>9. Use the Right Tone
and Voice </h3>



<p>Your online live chat presence should reflect your brand
identity. Therefore, your chat must have a distinct tone or voice. For example
– a high-end fashion brand will have a different tone than a company selling
soccer merchandise. &nbsp;</p>



<h3>10. Be Positive</h3>



<p>Being positive and friendly in live chat can help you win
your customers over. 

These are the ten best practices for live chart
support your business must follow. In case you do not have the manpower and
budget to offer live chat support round the clock, you can hire a BPO that
offers live chat support as a service.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are the days when customers had to use a phone to communicate with a business. Today, we have numerous communication channels that can help a customer reach a business without having to spend time in the call queue. Among these channels, live chat is the most satisfying communication channel for over <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/live-chat-customer-support/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">73% </a>customers.</p>
<p>In this age of online shopping, many customers look for answers to their questions in real time with precision. To resolve this, many businesses have added live chat support that helps businesses provide an answer to customer questions in real time. Apart from that they also have quite a few benefits:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6329" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/live-chat-customer-support.jpg" alt="live chat is the most satisfying communication channel" width="600" height="342" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/live-chat-customer-support.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/live-chat-customer-support-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3>1. Convenient for Customers</h3>
<p>Many online consumers want help from a live person while they are shopping online. A study called “<a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/Making+Proactive+Chat+Work/-/E-RES57054" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Making Proactive Chat Work</a>” conducted by Forrester Research found that 44% of online consumers say that having questions answered by a live person while in the middle of an online purchase is one of the most important features a Web site can offer.</p>
<p>Live chat gives online customers an immediate access to help. Wait times are often significantly less than phone support, and customers can easily multi-task while waiting.</p>
<p>According to an ATG Global Consumer Trend <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20091007005074/en/ATG-Survey-Reveals-Two-Thirds-Online-Consumers-Live" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a>, 90% of customers consider live chat helpful. As per an eMarketer.com <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/How-Helpful-Live-Chat/1007235" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">survey</a>, 62% customers are more likely to purchase again from a site with live chat while 38% respondents said that they made the purchase because of the chat session.</p>
<h3>2. Cost-Effective</h3>
<p>While live chat software can be a considerable investment at first,  it will drastically lessen both employee task time and phone expenses. Live chat reduces contact center costs by lowering average interaction costs. It increases efficiency by allowing live chat agents to handle multiple chats simultaneously (4-5 chats), thus reducing the need to hire more.</p>
<p>With agents spending less time on the phone, they will be able to multi-task during chat conversations and cut the waiting queue to a bare minimum, thus increasing the chance of overall sales.</p>
<h3>3. Increases Sales</h3>
<p>To quote a <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/Case+Study+Wells+Fargo+Proves+The+Business+Case+For+Online+Chat/-/E-RES57154" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">study</a> by Forbes magazine &#8211; “<em>In 2008, Wells Fargo made a second attempt to leverage online chat to drive sales, and happily, this time the results have been crystal clear. High customer satisfaction scores and a double-digit increase in converted shoppers have shown the value once and for all of this technology</em>.”</p>
<p>The main aim of a live chat support is that customers should have someone who can help them during a purchase by answering their important questions and resolving their confusions regarding a product or service.  It helps eliminate bounces away from e-commerce websites and ensure that the products or services carts make it through check out.</p>
<h4>4. Gives You an Edge of Your Competition</h4>
<p>If you want to gain an edge on the competition, live chat is a necessary feature to add to your website.  Live chat provides a simple way to connect with customers who spend a good deal of their money online.  According to <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/How-Helpful-Live-Chat/1007235" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">E-Marketer</a>, “<em>Almost two in 10 live chat respondents did more than 75% of their holiday shopping online, compared with 14% of those who did not chat. A further 25% of chatters made 51% to 75% of their purchases on the Web, versus just 10% of those who did not participate in the chat service</em>.”</p>
<p>So, besides cost benefits, customer support, and increased sale, live chat support can help you book the top spot ahead of your competition.</p>
<h3>5. Access to Customer Pain Points</h3>
<p>A chat support is an excellent opportunity for a company to know the frustrations and needs that are yet to be filled. When customers use live chat, they’ll try to ensure that a product will perform as advertised or that a promotion will provide the discount they are looking for. In addition, as live chat agents talk to customers, they can find out how a customer wants to improve a company’s products and services.</p>
<p>These are some of the benefits a business can reap by incorporating live chat support on their website.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this busy world more and more people are turning to texting as well as instant messaging as their primary route of communication. In such a situation, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/telephone-answering-service-vs-live-chat-service.html">live chat has become growing channel</a> for customer support.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/3159017/best-practices-making-live-chat">Gartner report</a> that its presence as a customer engagement channel will increase from 2% to 10% of all interactions by 2018, with over 80% of companies making it available for their customers.</p>
<p>As understanding customer behavior is vital to delivering outstanding customer service, it is important to reflect on the customer journey. Thanks to the uninterrupted Internet connection, customers these days can look for answers to their questions at any point of time via search engines, FAQs, blogs, forum posts and even social media.</p>
<p>However, it is often seen that they often turn to live chat as it allows them to multitask more efficiently and at the same time, get real-time answers.</p>
<p>To top it off, they can easily bypass the issues they face while using other channels, such as waiting on hold in case of calls and selecting options in case of IVR.</p>
<p>Live chat is one of the first interactions of a customer with a company. Therefore, while using live chat a customer is at an early stage of the customer journey. A company can, therefore, use live chat as an opportunity to delight their customers, reduce channel switching and build customer loyalty.</p>
<p>There are numerous benefits of <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/3-aspects-of-customer-management-strategize-for-live-chat-channels.html">live chat as a customer support channel</a> both for the companies and their customers. However, to reap those benefits, one has to use this channel correctly. Here is a checklist of live chat best practices that can be of help.</p>
<h2>Live Chat Best Practices for a Better Customer Experience</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Ask Questions</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You must be wondering- how clichéd is answering a question with a question? Well, often it is a necessary route to take. This way, you can bypass making assumptions about customer problems and avoid further miscommunication and frustrated channel-switching.</p>
<p>Let your customers know that you are focused on finding a resolution but that you will need more information (as well as confirmation) from them to do so.</p>
<p>This is particularly true in case your prospects use live chat to get an idea of pricing or specific features. But to answer these questions, you almost always need more information.</p>
<p>There will be times when you cannot resolve an issue no matter how many questions you ask. The resolution will take further research. In that case, it is important to let the customer know that. They are looking for fast resolution. If you cannot provide that, you should take measures to reduce their frustration.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Be Concise</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Avoid industry jargons while talking about your product or service. Remember, your customers are not very familiar with technical lingo.  Apart from that, try not to get wordy in your responses, over-explaining or repeating yourself.</p>
<p>Customers using live chat are looking for quick answers. Sometimes they are in a rush, and sometimes they are simply too intimidated to call.  The best way to serve them with a delightful experience is to be concise in your answers and use familiar language.</p>
<p>However, live chat agents should make every effort to avoid typos; it is a one-way road to tarnishing your brand image.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>Be Personable</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Using canned script to answer live chat is a very common practice. But is should be avoided at all cost. It sounds very robotic and lacks the personal touch of a one to one interaction.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to align your live chat strategy with your customer experience strategy. You can empower your agents to empathize with customers to understand their needs and help them reach solutions.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, customers want to feel heard and understood by live humans who will give special importance to their concerns. Modifying the templated answer to support individual customers is the key to a differentiated customer experience.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Build a Knowledgebase</h3>
