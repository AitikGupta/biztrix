<p>Customer service has gone through a sea of changes in the
recent past. So far, the changes have helped businesses improve the quality of
customer service and deliver state-of-the-art customer experience.</p>



<p>So, what made businesses think that a change in their
customer service model is necessary? Here are four realities that compelled
businesses to rethink:</p>



<h3>1. Smartphones In Every Pocket </h3>



<p>Nowadays one can find heavily featured smartphones being used in different parts of the world. Pew Research <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2999631/phones/pew-survey-shows-68-percent-of-americans-now-own-a-smartphone.html">reports</a> that in 2015 68% of American adults owned smartphones, almost double the 35% penetration in 2011. That means nearly every American has a supercomputer in his or her pocket.</p>



<p>The smartphone and the tablet are all-purpose devices that let us interact in a variety of modes &#8211; phone, email, text, web chat, video chat, social media, online forums and much more. As a result, people do not want to stick with just one mode of communication at a time: they switch modes as they please, and expect companies to keep up so that they don&#8217;t have to repeat their back-story to different personnel along the way. </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>With a smartphone in every pocket, companies can no longer stick to just one or two customer interaction channels. They should be present in a variety of channels so that a customer can reach them easily via the channel of his/her choice. When it comes to customer service, omnichannel is the way to go. </p>



<p>With <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/benefits-of-adopting-omnichannel-customer-support.html">omnichannel customer service</a>, a customer receives a seamless experience across all channels. Now, that is a customer service model that never goes out of style.</p>



<h3>2. 5G </h3>



<p>Over the next two years, the transition from 4G to 5G will make the public wireless network experience a huge 300 times faster. With <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-5g-everything-you-need-to-know">5G</a>, we will see devoted slices of spectrum, ready for tuning and optimization for specific applications and devices. The blend of these two phenomena, when met with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-internet-things-affect-customer-service-near-future-saraogi/">IoT</a>/M2M devices, will facilitate secure real-time data transfer. That means no delay. </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>In the age of 5G the faster a company can put data into action, the more value it can deliver. This is only possible when you put AI into the mix. When your customer service agents get <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">real-time assistance from AI</a>, it will be possible for them to assist your customers right away.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5G.jpg" alt="5G" class="wp-image-6617" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5G.jpg 650w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5G-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></figure></div>



<p>Here’s an example – if you get a call from your customer that his/her car broke down in the middle of the road, your customer service agent can take help of AI to resolve the issue quickly. AI can quickly show the agent the actual location of your customer, the location of the nearest tow truck and the time it will take the tow truck to arrive. It can also notify the tow truck, show the agent the location of the nearest clinic in case the customer needs medical assistance, saving your agent the time to manually look for the information and make the necessary calls. As a result, you can provide your customer with real-time assistance.</p>



<h3>3. Getting Smart </h3>



<p>Smart watches, smart cars, smart TVs, and other smart
devices continue to have a mammoth impact on consumer-oriented experiences.
Companies are building customer experiences around smart connected devices and
reshaping customer expectations in the process. The effect in the B2B segment
will be just as remarkable and will go beyond the automatic or single-tap
wireless updating of software features and bug fixes. </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>For most people, the best customer experience would be one that provides problem resolution without them having to know about it. Otherwise, one where the device notifies customer service based on a data trigger, empowering the user to help solve the issue on his terms.</p>



<p>As we shoot up the connectivity, contact center agents and technicians will increasingly interact not only with people but also with a wide range of devices, requiring these experts to hone their skills to handle different questions and complex situations.</p>



<h3>4. Big Data Getting Bigger</h3>



<p>Considering the ABI Research <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240227341/IoT-enabled-devices-to-cross-40-billion-by-2020">report</a>
that IoT/M2M will reach 40 billion in 2020, it is safe to say that connected
devices will soon outnumber people 5:1 or more. And they will generate a lot of
data.&nbsp; To deliver excellent customer
service businesses has to process this data to put the right information into
the right Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </p>



<p><strong>Changes in customer service model to cope with this reality: </strong></p>



<p>At present customer service agents get access to just the performance information and customer data available in the CRM. That is a small slice of data that is often segmented. To use big data to its full potential, businesses have to analyze all data points and spread it across an organization along with other data. AI, data science, and machine learning can help you with that. </p>



<p>These advanced technologies will help you process big data faster, analyze the data to get better understanding of your customers and their expectations and using the same for future customer interactions. They will help agents get the full picture and deliver faster resolution, create more upsell/cross-sell opportunities, and ultimately deliver a superior customer experience.</p>



<p>Smartphones, 5G, devices, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wearable-technology-change-face-customer-service-kishore-saraogi/">wearables</a>, as well as big data, will continue to bring positive changes in customer service. Is your customer service ready to deliver new customer experience? </p>

<p>Chatbots have been on the rise since a couple of years and
have already gained popularity. Chatbots can help businesses interact with
their customers and prospects in a new way using messaging apps, the latest
technology, and Artificial Intelligence. </p>



<h2>What is a Chatbot?</h2>



<p>A chatbot is a service that can interact with you just like a real person. Powered by rules and  Artificial Intelligence, chatbots are programmed to simulate a real conversation with users through a chat interface. They are based on machine learning to imitate human conversation and react to service requests.</p>



<p>AI helps them learn the language, human tone, and behavior with every interaction, which in turn helps them to be more intelligent and serve the users better. </p>



<p>For a better understanding of how chatbots can contribute to
your business, let us find the top 7 benefits of chatbots:</p>



<h2>1. Being Present on Messaging Platforms</h2>



<p>Today messaging applications have more users than social
media network. And as customers today think that chat is a convenient and
faster way to interact with a business, businesses today have the chance to
reach more audience via chatbots while staying trendy.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The Majority of smartphone users today do not want to
download new apps. So, businesses can integrate their chatbot in one of the
popular platforms that the customers use on a daily basis such as &#8211; Facebook,
Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. It will also save you time and money. </p>



<h2>2. Improved Customer Service</h2>



<h4>A. Extensive Customer Assistance</h4>



<p>According to a <a href="https://econsultancy.com/83-of-online-shoppers-need-support-to-complete-a-purchase-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">survey</a>, 83% of online shoppers want assistance during shopping. So, your customers may need assistance at any time. Additionally, shoppers may also face navigation issues, or have queries about registration, payment, checkout, and delivery or about the product itself.</p>



<p>In such situations, chatbots can provide real-time assistance through interactive communication over text and voice. They can also provide customers with important relevant information from knowledge base, blogs, tutorial videos and so on.</p>



<h4>B. Always-Available Customer Support</h4>



<p>A great 24/7 customer service has a positive impact on customer satisfaction. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">Chatbots can help you improve the customer support</a> process by quickly giving automated answers to repetitive questions immediately and forwarding the complex ones to a human agent.</p>



<p>Apart from that, chatbots allow businesses to attend more queries at the same time, allowing companies to scale up their operation to new markets globally.</p>



<h4>C. Proactive Customer Interaction</h4>



<p>Companies can also use chatbots to start <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/proactive-customer-service-and-how-to-start-practicing-it.html">proactive customer interactions</a> regarding any issue, any time of the day. This will make your customers feel that your brand cares for them on a 24/7 basis. This can help improve your brand perception in the long run.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chatbot-example.jpg" alt="AI-Based Chatbot Example" class="wp-image-6579" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chatbot-example.jpg 720w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chatbot-example-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<h2>3. Increased Customer Engagement</h2>



<p>Chatbots can be a great tool for customer engagement.
Chatbots can provide the customers with a specific slice of information and
lead the interaction based on the user input at that time.&nbsp; This way, chatbots never provides a dull
interaction with irrelevant and useless information resulting in better
engagement. </p>



<h2>4. Monitoring Consumer Data and Gaining Insights</h2>



<p>Businesses can make changes in their service/products based on the feedback chatbots collect through simple questions. As chatbots are also capable of tracking purchasing patterns and consumer behavior by monitoring user data, they can also help a company to decide marketing strategies.</p>



<p>Companies can use chatbots to track consumer request and responses, predict responses based on the language and direct the chatbot to suggest an alternative product or service. </p>



<h2>5. Cost Savings</h2>



<p>Implementing a full functioning chatbot is cheaper and faster than creating a cross-platform app or hiring chat support agents for each task. Businesses today can <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="choose from ready-made applications (opens in a new tab)">choose from ready-made applications</a> developed by Facebook, Microsoft, and other IT giants.</p>



<p>Being automated solutions, chatbots can handle many customers at once, saving employee costs and eliminating the scope for human errors. Finally, as customers can access chatbots easily within seconds and interact immediately, the cost of user acquisition also comes down.</p>



<p>These are some of the major benefits chatbots bring to your business. with technological advancements, chatbots will become smarter, better and more effective. As chatbot gradually gain maturity, this is the right time to adopt this new technology and give your business an edge.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is becoming important for contact centers to undergo communication revolution as more and more customers connect with a brand through social channels. Love it or hate it, social media is going to have a strong impact in coming days.</p>
<p>Social Media is growing; well this means you have to find out where you stand so that it becomes easy to sail with the wave of the communication revolution.</p>
<p>With the development of the advertising business model over the social networks, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.in/How-Companies-Are-Using-Social-Media-To-Become-More-Customer-Centric/articleshow/22145991.cms" target="_blank">integrating social CRM</a> to business has become essential, quotes <a href="http://www.genesys.com/about-genesys/resources/gartner-predicts-2014-customer-support-and-the-engaged-enterprise" target="_blank">Gartner</a>. Three years ago, experts predicted that, by 2020, Facebook and a partner might emerge as a major CRM force. However, now they claim that, by the end of the year 2016 Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn will develop social media engagement applications supporting both marketing and customer service.</p>
<p>With this green signal in business, state-of-the-art global BPOs like Fusion are on the verge of adopting social CRM. Business hesitates when they think to invest in social CRM as they are unsure of definite ROI. However, Fusion BPO agrees with the experts, who suggest that direct offering from platforms like Facebook and Twitter bring great value to entry level customers leading to competition between multichannel analytics.</p>
<h3>How Social CRM Can Bring On Revolutions In Customer Communication?</h3>
<p>In order to develop a customer focused strategy we need to balance &#8211; <b><i>the customer wants with what service providers can do realistically and channels they can use to render incomparable services.</i></b> With social CRM, contact centers can develop rewards program that would get <a href="http://www.sociableblog.com/2012/06/04/social-crm-customer-engagement/" target="_blank">customers talk to peers about their experience</a> on the various products.</p>
<p>Social CRM is about growing culture and technology. It helps contact centers to get access to the whole list of tools from traditional sales force automation and customer service to social CRM tools such as Big Data management, social media monitoring and collaboration tools.</p>
<p>The basic tenet of social CRM that compels contact centers to join the wave of communication revolution say – <i>“it  is the buyer and not the seller who controls the conversation and this cultural change is adhesive for business process outsourcing, as outsourcers mainly focuses on strengthening customer-to-business bonding.”</i></p>
<h3>Five Phases That Contact Centers Has To Adopt For Integrating Social CRM</h3>
<p>Here, we are going to outline five stages that global contact centers need to adopt to integrate social CRM in their business processing module.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Your Business needs to be Present</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the first stage where your business starts listening to the conversation and feels for different social media options. This is the juncture when call centers may take advantage of existing monitoring and analytics, or use the free tools to track down company or brand mentions on behalf of their B2B clients.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Analysis of Different Social Media Platforms</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it is time to dip your toe into the social media channels in small fragments. It is not a departmental plan or a budget rather a part of marketing or PR where you need to involve your customer service. At the most, you need to establish the social media guidelines within the contact centers and strictly follow them. It is necessary to create goals and relate metrics at this point to expand social media engagement in the later phase.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Expanding the Social Media Presence</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the third stage, contact centers need to engage actively in the social media ecosystem. As social media often driven by budget and human resource needs, it starts to attain a corporate recognition. With the use of dedicated resources, contact centers need to lay down a social media contingency plan to handle issues in the case of emergency.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Integrating Social Media Across All Sectors</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has become a necessity to spread social media access to a variety of areas within the business. Especially in marketing, sales and customer service, the demand of social media is quite high. At contact centers, we are going to turn towards social media more and more as a reliable source of communication. This will helps us to have an integrated approach to client’s business and have a sophisticated brand monitoring.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Start A Social Business</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the last stage where contact centers need to develop social CRM, and become more engaged across the breadth of customer touch points. At this juncture, we need to track the social media metrics and costs and render sophisticated customer support across different channel and in multiple languages.</p>
<p>With the use of social CRM, Fusion BPO has started to change the global customer landscape. We feel that it is a tool not just to handle complaints, but it allows the customers to sculpt their own experience with the brand allowing us to bake those interactions to operation, so it all about mutual benefits.</p>
<p>Regardless of where we stand on the social media curve, Fusion focuses mainly on the increase in breadth of involvement. When it is done, we engage with customers and answer their concerns over the phone or email. Thus, it allows us to become more efficient in offering customer service to various brands belonging to different niche.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you mean by customer loyalty? – It is the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/top-3-call-center-practices-that-consumers-prefer.html">desire of the customer</a> to trust, consider and tolerate. This thought of customer loyalty is applicable across all verticals.</p>
<p>Certain industries are able to drive better consumer loyalty across different timeline. Who are these industries? – Contact centers. They are the higher driver of loyalty in different touch points on the macro level in the telecom environment better than a retail chain.</p>
<p>Well, we are not saying that the contact center is not the strong loyalty driver in the retail industry, but over the phone they can build bigger experience. However, the basis for consumer loyalty depends on the in-store experience, and we know that it will bring a broad smile of the face of the customers.</p>
<p>Well, there are issues where we usually do not lose the loyalty towards the company. Like the company to whom we rely may keep us on hold for more than half an hour and resolve the problem for a next half an hour, but still they do not lose the trust of the customer.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are instances where we do not have confidence on our service provider. Cable and internet work well and, we often do not have a problem with them. However, the billing and moving issues may lead to the contact centers, and their customers have a terrible contact center experiences. It drives the loyalty of the customers to a lower margin.</p>
<p>Installing advanced technology, contact centers want to improve their customer loyalty. Thus, the installation of <a class="zem_slink" title="Interactive voice response" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">IVR</a> and Visual IVR took place. Fusion plays a large role in the customer’s perception of the brand and, therefore, the experience needs to be flawless. Fusion thus uses IVR and Visual IVR to accelerate their call center performance.</p>
<p>Efficiency of the IVR comes with the combination of ease and speed. The <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/call-center-outsourcing-become-more-efficient.html">advanced IVR technologies</a> surpass the traditional IVR models. Since, the former gives more opportunity to influence the callers with sophisticated and brand reflecting automation that increase sales and the customer experience.</p>
<p>According to the survey done by the <a href="http://www.pvko.nl/upload/documenten/presentaties/CRM-Association-Gungor.pdf" target="_blank">Platform Voor Klantgericht Ondernemen</a> says, that on an average 20-30% of customers are delightful in keeping up the loyalty with a particular company, yet 10-25% are still disappointing. The survey also says that the negative contact has a stronger effect than the satisfied ones.</p>
<p>With the use of IVR technologies, the performance of the call center has boosted. Take a look at the table below for further details:</p>
<table style="border:solid 2px #4BACC6; width:600px; text-align:center" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center">
<tr>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">

</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">
<div align="center"><strong>Customer Satisfaction</strong></div>
</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">
<div align="center"><strong>Customer Loyalty</strong></div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">Happy Customers</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">76%</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">92%</td>

<tr style="background:#D2EAF1;">
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">Neutral &amp; Positive Customers</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">63%</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">82%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">Disappointed Customers</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">45%</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">59%</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background:#D2EAF1;">
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">Angry Customers</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">19%</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">45%</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Fusion believes in the motto – “<em>Positive the Customer Contacts, Stronger the Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty</em>. “</p>
<p>Fusion makes the automated experience seamless and thus our callers are more willing to buy. This helps to increase our customer trust, and if our customer is frustrated, the automated part of the call won’t increase the frustration level.</p>
<p>Thus, for a positive experience and better consumer loyalty, Fusion gives thumbs up for IVR solutions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the innovation of new contact center technologies, everyday businesses are opening up new channels of communication. Among all other contact center equipments, Voice-Over-IP (VoIP) is the most interesting and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/call-center-outsourcing-become-more-efficient.html" target="_blank">highly influencing technology</a>. In the recent days, VoIP technology is no more a gimmick. The international <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/voip-improves-call-center-performance.html" target="_blank">call centers prefer VoIP</a> to other equipments available in the market.</p>
<p>Why do we prefer to use VoIP technology at our call centers? Is VoIP the next big business trend of 2013?</p>
<p>Well, business owners have three good reasons to use VoIP at their call centers.</p>
<h3>1) VoIP Lessens the Cost</h3>
<p>If we look at our call center once, we will find that traditional phone services are installed in huge numbers. Those phone services runs on copper wires and are taxed or regulated by the federal, state, and local governments. The governments add surcharges and taxes, as a result of which you have to pay heavy phone bills at the end of the month. When traditional phone service is compared to the internet, it is the internet, which wins. It is free from all kind of pesky fees that adds up over time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.business.att.com/content/whitepaper/forrester_att_voip_tap.pdf" target="_blank">Research</a> done by the Forrester Group, says that around 51% of the contact center companies are adopting VoIP, to offer better solutions to their customers. The research also affirmed that the call centers are able to lower down their transaction and communication cost by 60% to 61% in 2012. Therefore, contact center managers are keeping their hopes high in 2013.</p>
<h3>2) VoIP Enables the Easy Way to Send Fax</h3>
<p><a href="http://compnetworking.about.com/od/voipvoiceoverip/g/fax_over_ip.htm" target="_blank">IP based fax</a> (FoIP) solutions takes about $5 per month. It helps to send and receive fax from the laptops, Smartphone and even the age-old fax machines.</p>
<p>Actually, IP faxing is environment-friendly equipment and reduces the need of paper and printer ink and the fax machine itself. IP faxing is a revolution and helps a business to overcome the hurdles of traditional communication equipments. It helps call center owners to save money every month. At Fusion, we are using VoIP and have boosted our company to gain quick and efficient reputation due to the quick fax response.</p>
<h3>3) Use of VoIP Makes it Easy to Scale</h3>
<p>With a traditional model of communication, it is hard to add and reduce extensions, but with VoIP, it is easy to add extensions. These extensions can be directed to any phone, across the world, allowing employees to do their work from home.</p>
<p>These three benefits illuminate the VoIP monitoring and bring a number of benefits to call centers. Well, VoIP has one major disadvantage, clogging networks and other performance issues can bring down the call quality.</p>
<p>However, you will come across VoIP solutions, which gives you, access to granular view of metrics and shows the performance level on every VoIP call, which is placed. With VoIP monitoring, you are going to stay one-step ahead in the contact center industry. Forrester Group says that 36% of the major companies are considering the implementation of the VoIP as important in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Switch to the new technologies to escalate your call center performance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contact centers spent a large sum (in millions) every year on different advanced and innovative technologies. Why do contact centers spend huge amounts on advanced technologies?  It’s simply out of the hope of improving the company’s competitive position, operational performance and cost structure.</p>
<p>Managers assume that the sophisticated contact center technology provides better performance and in turn improves the KPIs (<em>Key Performance Indicators</em>).</p>
<p>What are the KPIs? &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer Satisfaction</li>
<li>First Contact Resolution</li>
<li>Cost Per Contact</li>
</ul>
<p>Even we at Fusion do strive to improve our KPI factors, to keep our customer satisfaction level high.</p>
<p>Although many <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/call-center-outsourcing-become-more-efficient.html">call centers opt for technological improvement</a> each year based on the assumption that better technology will result in better performance and boost the KPIs, hardly any company has done a thorough research on the diverse contact center to indicate whether a relationship truly exist between technology and better performance or not.</p>
<p>CISCO and other large companies like Benchmarkportal and Naquitline recently did a thorough research and collected huge data to determine the relationship between the contact center technologies and performance. After their research, many companies have looked through the survey and reached a similar overview – “better contact center technology has a lot to contribute. “</p>
<p>Companies are of the opinion more advanced technologies means effective customer interaction and better outputs. They reached a desirable conclusion that advanced technologies can improve the following factors.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Better Customer Satisfaction</i></li>
<li><i>Low Cost per Call</i></li>
<li><i>Increase the First Contact Resolution</i></li>
<li><i>Rise in Calls Handled By Each Agent per Hour</i></li>
<li><i>Reducing the Queue Time</i></li>
<li><i>Improving Satisfaction of Agents</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, let us look into the data, which different contact centers have calculated during their individual surveys.</p>
<p>1) <a href="http://www.benchmarkportal.com/public/pdf/Sample-12-KPI-Industry-Benchmark-Report.pdf" target="_blank">According</a> to Benchmarkportal; the advanced contact center technology improves the first call resolution rate between 4% to 13%, with the use of the following technologies like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced Call Reporting And Analytical Tools</li>
<li>Contact Center Data Analytics</li>
<li>Advanced Call Routing Capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>2) <a href="http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.naquitline.org/resource/resmgr/issue_papers/callcentermetricspaperstaffi.pdf" target="_blank">According</a> to Naquitline, reports of cost per call lowers as much as 35% with advanced contact center technologies. The field which it lowers the call cost include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Courtesy Callbacks</li>
<li>Presence-Based Expert Escalation</li>
<li>Integration Of Advanced Apps And CTI (<a class="zem_slink" title="Computer telephony integration" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_telephony_integration" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Computer Telephony Integration</a>)</li>
<li>Multi-Criteria &amp; <a class="zem_slink" title="Skills-based routing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skills-based_routing" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Skills-Based Routing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>3) According to the findings of Benchmarkportal, contact center can notice the improvement of Top Box Customer Satisfaction (means the customers who rate their satisfaction mark as 5 out of 5) by between 5% and 7% using modern technologies like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workforce Management</li>
<li>Cradle To Grave Reporting</li>
<li>Contact Data Analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>4) Improves the Bottom Box Customer Satisfaction (customers who rate their satisfaction in 1 out of 5) between 39% and 66% with the use of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Touch Tone IVR (<a class="zem_slink" title="Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">DTMF</a>)</li>
<li>Workforce Management</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/recognition-in-call-centers.html">Speech Recognition</a></li>
<li>Call Recording &amp; Retrieval</li>
</ul>
<p>5) The survey done by the famous companies like CISCO also found that the technologies are also able to improve the calls per agent in an hour by 6% and 18%, using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural Language IVR</li>
<li>CTI &amp; Apps Integration</li>
<li>Multi Criteria Routing</li>
<li>Presence-Based Expert Escalation</li>
<li>Unified Cross-Channel Routing</li>
</ul>
<p>6) Escalates the Top Box Agent Satisfaction (agents who rate themselves 1 out of 5 for overall satisfaction) between 4% to 11% says Benchmarkportal, with the use of technologies like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced Reporting &amp; Analytics</li>
<li>Agent Desktop with CTI</li>
<li>CTI &amp; Apps Integration</li>
<li>Real Time Agent Feedback Tools</li>
</ul>
<p>7) The contact center also witnessed the decline in Average Queue Time between 12% to 43% by the use of technologies like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blended Routing</li>
<li>Presence Based Expert Escalation</li>
<li>Courtesy Call Back while in Queue</li>
<li>Multi Criteria Routing</li>
</ul>
<p>8) Improves the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/can-contact-centers-eliminate-call-holding-time.html">Multi-Channel support</a> like e-mail and chat to increase performance by implementing technologies like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal Multi-Channel Queue</li>
<li>Unified Cross-Channel Routing</li>
<li>CTI &amp; Apps Integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Everywhere the result affirmed that the contact centers of today could be the potent enablers of superior performance. For both, satisfying the customers and improving financial performance of the contact center.</p>
<p>We saw that this research found that cost and quality are not at odds. With advanced contact center technology, one can lower the call cost but can withhold their customer satisfaction level.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where do you see yourself in 5 years from now? – A common but seemingly unnerving question from the interviewer. How can one correctly predict his future? And yet having a vision, a goal and prudence is essential. The same thing applies for outsourcing business. No one can predict what the future has in store for the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-india-is-taking-business-to-the-next-level.html">global outsourcing industry</a>, but one can surely have an idea –</p>
<p>As per the outsourcing experts, over the period next 5 years &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Offshore vendors will differentiate themselves more depending on service offered and industry verticals served. To be in the market, they need to demonstrate specific skills and knowledge and not just cost arbitrage.</li>
<li>Certain industries like retail, education and travel in continue to lean heavily on outsourcing while others may not significantly increase their offshore functions.</li>
<li>Non-voice contact centers will increasingly be performed offshore and its great will be significantly higher than the low growth experienced in the total voice sector.</li>
<li>Clients of outsourced vendors will have a better idea of what works offshore and what does not. This will reflect in their outsourcing pattern.</li>
<li>Offshore remote &#8211; based agents will not rise significantly. But offshore call centers that focus on cold call sales, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/life-insurance-appointment-setting-service-quality-life-insurance-leads.html">appointment setting</a>, customer support and IT support will keep thriving.</li>
<li>Offshore vendors will be the main beneficiary of non-voice contact center activity including email and chat support, order processing, social media communications, email marketing etc.</li>
<li>India and The Philippines will continue to be the main benefactor of global outsourcing industry.</li>
<li>Low-end outbound activity will continue to be a strong area of growth for offshore</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, as <a href="http://www.call-centres.com/articles/?p=39" target="_blank">Rob O’Malley</a> is right to point out, there is no longer a place for weak offshore vendors in the next 5 years. Only those who are able to differentiate services will remain in business in the long run. Having a track record of offering services specific to different industry verticals, <em>Fusion </em>strongly believes that to be in business, an outsourcing vendor needs to stress more on specialized services, agent training and cost handling.</p>
<p>Fusion is also of the opinion that in another 5 years, <a href="http://www.sociableblog.com/2013/01/28/how-to-choose-the-right-cloud-for-your-business/" target="_blank">cloud-based systems</a> will dominate the call center industry. Everything from customer data to telephony software will be available on cloud, giving call centers greater flexibility and savings. Since Fusion has contact centers in US, Canada, India and the Philippines, It will also be easy for them to manage the operations through cloud.</p>
<p>In other words, 5 years from now, intelligent call centers that can adapt to ever-changing technology, customized requirements of their clients and their customers (who will be reaching the call centers through various channels including telephone, chat, email, social network etc.), will continue to operate. This vision has lead Fusion to adapt some important changes in their operational strategies. It plans to give special attention on the following areas.</p>
<h3>Intelligent call routing</h3>
<p>As a matter of fact, social media and web 2.0 channels have over 50% penetration in different contact center operations while around 25% smartphone users use internet on phone, the role of a contact center is changing rapidly. And to adapt to such changes, every contact center needs a <a href="http://unified-communications.tmcnet.com/topics/unified-communications/articles/322922-uc-expansion-feeds-off-byod-growth.htm" target="_blank">BYOD</a> intelligent call routing based on the following –</p>
<ul>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Type of request</li>
<li>Communication channels or device</li>
</ul>
<p>This will essentially reduce the call transfer by 1-2 minutes per call and thus will help offer better service.</p>
<h3>Role of Agents</h3>
<p>Owing to various needs of the customers, the role of agents will also change. They need to be</p>
<ul>
<li>Product or service specialist</li>
<li>Multilingual</li>
<li>Expert in social engagement and response</li>
<li>Expert in Conflict resolution and crisis resolution</li>
<li>Specialist in cross selling and up selling</li>
</ul>
<p>Training agents to handle all kind of issues and on specialized services can help clients to get better service for their customers. Having <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/multilingual-call-center.html">multilingual</a> and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/french-call-center.html">French-speaking agents</a> on board, Fusion will get the maximum benefit of an intelligent routing system.</p>
<h3>Broadening Of Social Media, Web and Email Support</h3>
<p>With customers using different communication channels, the contact centers too needs to <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/social-customer-services-personalize-customer-support.html">broaden its social media and web support</a> approach. As non-voice operations are going to have a bigger share of contact center operations, Fusion is stressing on the non-voice services as well.</p>
<h3>Specialization to Cater to Different Industry Verticals</h3>
<p>Fusion has a long experience in offering customize services specific to different industry verticals. Travel (including <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/travel_tourism.html">Timeshare</a>), education, financial services and retail are some of the verticals that the company caters to.</p>
<p>Apart from these, Fusion also recommends maintaining a customer-centric approach in the work culture. To achieve this, one needs to-</p>
<ul>
<li>Adapt new technologies</li>
<li>Create a proper data management ecosystem and use right person at the right place on right time.</li>
<li>Empower agents to offer unique user experience</li>
<li>Use new channels to offer a great customer service.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a contact center can adapt these changes, they can emerge as the next-gen contact center that is here to stay.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CRM or customer relationship management is the model for managing a company interacts with the current and the future customers on the database.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Call center outsourcing being one of the top business trends for quite some time now, questions are bound to arise whether or not the outsourcing sector underwent any change. The truth is, a lot has changed here and changed for the good. From the outsourcing destinations to the technologies used for serving clients to the scope of functions, change is prominent everywhere and anywhere.</p>
<p>The best part is all these changes have more or less yielded positive results, call center services have become economic and even more efficient. Be it advanced <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/customer-relationship-management-is-required-in-call-centers.html">Customer Relationship Management</a> (CRM) technologies or cost effective outsourcing destinations, present day business enterprises have found a very reliable and most importantly competent business partner in the call center companies.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4677" title="Call Center Outsourcing Become More Efficient" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/technology-call-center.jpg" alt="Call Center Outsourcing Become More Efficient" width="600" height="325" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/technology-call-center.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/technology-call-center-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Let us have a closer look at the changes that have made life easier and economic for contemporary entrepreneurs. For convenience let us discuss the same under three broad headings.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>A) </strong><strong>Innovation and Upgrade in the Field of Technology</strong>:</span></h3>
<p>In these times of constrained budgets and extremely competitive market scenario, the only thing that delights entrepreneurs is the ongoing technological innovations in the corporate customer service hubs. Call center companies and their agents are up on the toes to improve and expand the CRM technologies. At the same time they have in mind the cost considerations. Constant efforts are being made to keep the pricing as affordable as possible.</p>
<p>Now that businesses aim to globalize their operations, the technology at disposal should be adept enough. Such has been the level of development and progress in the realm of call center technology that many, like Jason Compton say that the modern call center agents are even capable of ‘following the sun’. No matter to which part of the world the entrepreneurs want to expand their activities, present day CRM technologies are capable to offer support to customers located in any nook and corner of the globe.</p>
<p>Most call center companies have multiple functional sites spread all over the world. And if noticed, we will see bulks of these new operational sites are located in the lower-cost countries. Such a move is guided by definite reasons. We shall have a look at the same in the next section. As of now let us focus on the changes that the call centers have experienced in the realm of technology. These are the changes that make these external vendors so much more effective and efficient.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VOIP in place of PSTN</strong>: Customer Relationship Management has become better and easier with the introduction of VOIP in place of PSTN that is a switch from circuit-switched telephony to packet-switched telephony. There are many external vendors who chose to stick to the traditional PSTN system, IP telephony have opened up doors for upgrading. What is perhaps the most attractive feature, VOIP is really economic.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Voice Response (IVR)</strong>: <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/system-for-call-centers.html">Interactive Voice Response system</a> permits the call handling executives to automate services. This saves good bit of time and money as well. Now automated answering service machines are used for handling routine inquiries. The agents are free for addressing more complex issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For example</em> &#8211; in case of a <a href="http://www.ordersatellitenow.com/" target="_blank">satellite TV service provider</a>, calls seeking information on account balance can be addressed through IVR. And for any inquiry or information as to how to install a particular device or how a particular feature operates it is better to approach a live agent.</p>
<p>Wondering how the IVR system works? First callers have to dial specific numbers as instructed by the pre recorded voice. Then the well maintained database is accessed to pull in the necessary information and assist the caller. Many IVR systems are blessed with speech recognition technology and a few can actually gather feedback from customers once the interaction is over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration of Live and Automated Answering Service</strong>: No doubt IVR has made life easier for answering service agents but callers still prefer live answering service agents. As a matter of fact there are several issues that can be dealt only and only by live agents. Here in the CTI technology i.e. Computer Technology Integration acts as a bridge between the IVR agents and agent workstations.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For example</em> &#8211; a customer wants to book a flight ticket. Because of system issues the transaction stops mid way. CTI ensures that all the information that the customer have already shared are stored. Here from the agent can take over. This accelerates handling time and saves the customers some frustration; he/she does not need to provide the same information all over again. Above all he/she is being assisted by a live agent now.</p>
<p>Most call center companies use a perfect blending of live answering service and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/answering-service-by-bpo-manila.html">automated answering services</a> to strike a balance between economy and efficiency.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Effective Call Routing facility</strong>: Modern call center technology enables skill based routing. This call routing facility ensures that senior agents handles the complex issues. This definitely has positive impacts all round including customer’s perception of the business. Much to the surprise this facility is hugely underutilized. According to a survey conducted by the Service Quality Management Group only a very limited number of contact centers, as low as one third of the total number of vendors use it. Experts strongly recommend the use of this facility for a better performance.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud based services</strong>: With VOIP all that the call center agents need is an access to the internet. They can get the liberty to work from home. And for the supervisors, they can supervise and monitor from anywhere and everywhere. There is no need of servers on premise, media gateways on the premise, support services can be offered from any corner of the globe. This is exactly the reason why call center industry has shifted its base to the third world countries. But this development we shall discuss later.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new cloud based services are flexible, scalable, secured, transparent, cost effective, easy to implement and above all reliable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration with the web and social media</strong>: As a very attractive part of the new <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/cloud-crm-tips-you-need-to-know.html">cloud based services</a>, call center companies now make use of the web and Social Media as Service (SMAS). This has expanded the horizon and reach of the call center agents. At the end of the day it is the business enterprises driven by profit motives that have benefited from this integration with the web world. Offering customer support, gathering customer feedback and customer outreach have become easier than never before.</li>
</ul>
<p>The host of improved <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/Trends-and-Technology-45155.aspx" target="_blank">technology tools and gadgets</a> will make things easier but for the perfect results Tim Hickernell, senior program director at META Group, advises caution in vendor selection. More technology intensive the services have become more is the need for expert and experienced call center agents.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>B) </strong><strong>Expansion of the Scope of Functions of Call Center Companies</strong><strong>:</strong></span></h3>
<p>In consonance with the technological upgrade, contact center companies have expanded the scope of their functions. An industry that started with assisting the business executives in answering customer calls and taking down messages, have grown and grown substantially. Not only customer handling but also marketing the business products or services have been added to the list of duties and responsibilities. The good thing is, companies have not stopped by merely expanding the scope of functions they have concentrated in specialization as well.</p>
<p>The discussion on the latest CRM software made it pretty evident that customer relationship management is not only about answering customer calls; it holds a broader and wider connotation. The present day answering service agents not only answer calls, they try and build rewarding connections. Customers</p>
<p><strong>Improve the Business Sales Performance: </strong></p>
<p>Healthy business-buyer connection has all the potentials to influence the eventual sales figures in a positive way. Outstanding customer service leaves the customers happy and contented. A satisfied customer base brings in more sales opportunities in the form of repeat sales and sale through referrals. Now this is the main reason why the customer care executives slog so hard to put up a very positive business image or brand identity.</p>
<p>Improving sale figures through customer retention is not the only way how call center companies contribute to the sales performance. These days’ businesses outsource the entire marketing process to be taken care of by the experienced marketing agents at the disposal of these companies. And much to the delight of the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/inbound-call-center-services-in-manila-saves.html">entrepreneurs</a> this move has paid off.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, modern day contact center companies have a role to play in the all round development of the businesses. Right from increasing the productivity to improving the revenue figures to enhancing the overall business value- services offered by call center companies have a bearing in all these areas.</p>
<p><strong>New Areas of Call Center Activities: </strong></p>
<p>Besides serving the conventional industries guided by the profit motive the companies now have ventured into newer areas. The newer and unconventional areas where call centers have <a href="http://www.outsource2india.com/why_india/articles/new_areas.asp" target="_blank">made their presence</a> felt are the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>E- governance services</li>
<li>Retail services</li>
<li>Pharmaceutical research services</li>
<li>Financial services</li>
<li>Healthcare services</li>
</ul>
<p>From among the list the role of the call center companies in the area of e-governance is considered to be the most critical and crucial. Assistance from call center companies is expected to make it easier for the authorities to rule the state effectively and efficiently.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>C) </strong><strong>Recent  Noticeable Trends</strong><strong>: </strong></span></h3>
<p>Now that the technologies have changed for the better, it is logical that there have been other changes in the realm of call center outsourcing. And when talking about trends, outsourcing to offshore call center companies is one development that grabs the attention of one and all. So wondering where is the new hub of outsourcing located? The developing countries &#8211; India and Philippines are the leading destinations for outsourcing.</p>
<p><strong>Asia : The New Outsourcing Destination </strong></p>
<p>Gone are the days when entrepreneurs would outsource to none but call center companies located in close proximity to the business building. In sharp contrast to their yesteryear preferences call centers India, to be more accurate call centers Philippines have become their recent favorites. According to an article published on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/philippines-overtakes-india-as-hub-of-call-centers.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> US based business houses are resorting to call center companies in Manila for the Manila customer care executives to take care of their customers. However it cannot be denied that call centers India are the trend setters as far as offshore outsourcing is concerned.</p>
<p><strong>Why Asia? </strong></p>
<p>Such preference is undoubtedly guided by profit motives or we can say cost considerations keeping in mind the financial constraints that entrepreneurs are facing these days. Outsourcing to any of these Asian countries implies saving a good amount of business funds. Here <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/services.html">quality call center services</a> are offered at amazingly affordable rates.</p>
<p>Wondering how the companies strike a balance between investment and expenditure with such low service charges?</p>
<p>Well it is the economic labor charges that such competitive pricing of support services in this part of the world permits. Besides, the government of the above mentioned countries realizes how crucial the revenue earned by call center sector can be in the growth story of the national economies. To entice more number of foreign clients different incentives are offered that further brings down the costs.</p>
<p><strong>Offshore Outsourcing: Is It a Good Decision? </strong></p>
<p>Wondering what prompted entrepreneurs to take such a bold step? Well, technological upgrade is the answer. Call center technology as it has been discussed at length has made significant progress. The same technology has done away with the concerns and issues that distance between the service provider and business operation center otherwise would have led to. You must be thinking how? Let’s see how.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coordination, monitoring and supervision of different call center activities are no problem: </strong>One of the biggest concerns that entrepreneurs of yesteryears had was how to coordinate the different activities of the call center agents. Monitoring and evaluating their performance was another headache they had. The bone of contention here was, if the services offered by the agents weren’t scrutinized the quality of the service might suffer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again excessive dependence on a service provider is never good for the health of the enterprise, the entrepreneur or the in-house team that is in charge of looking at the outsourcing department should have the final key in their hands. As a matter of fact, improved call center technology have made coordination way easier.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geographically scattered agents are more of an advantage than disadvantage: </strong>The new web based call center technology permits customer care executives and even marketers to work from home. Can such geographical dispersion of agents create troubles as far as coordination, monitoring and supervision is concerned? Well no. The same advanced features of the virtual call center technology comes to rescue.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the call recording feature that enables call center quality assurance team as well as the in-house quality control team to record every single incoming and outbound call so that the agents’ performance can be evaluated. Web conferences can be arranged for to train and educate the agents. Similar conferences can be arranged for discussing the problems that the agents are facing or the mistakes they are making.</p>
<p>Now that the technology is capable of establishing link between the widely scattered agents, enterprises can hope to cater to the needs and requirements of their global customer base with utmost efficiency.</p>
<p>And the answer to the question raised at the very beginning of this section of the article is &#8211; yes, offshore outsourcing is a good decision indeed. Now businesses can cut down on their investment while keeping the return on the same as handsome as ever, an arrangement they were looking for so long.</p>
<p>So we can conclude on a positive note, the call center industry which began journey in the aftermath of globalization has further consolidated its position. Call centers be domestic or offshore are here to stay for a long time and serve the present day enterprises to achieve their stiff targets and goals. The future of these companies seems pretty bright and so does the future of business enterprises.</p>
