								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="&quot;lightbox&quot;&quot;" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/us-call-center.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4479" title="us call center" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/us-call-center.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="220" /></a>A virtual or a web based call center is the most recent development in the field of business process outsourcing. And within a decade it has scored over the traditional call center companies in terms of popularity. Wondering what is so new and so enticing about a virtual call center? Well there is nothing new really, it is just that they are different in their staffing pattern that lowers their substantial cost.</p>
<p>A traditional <strong><a title="us call center" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/">US call center</a></strong> usually has employees sitting in adjacent cubicles and taking care of the client business needs. In case of a web based call center agents work from different distant geographical locations even from their home. This reduces their operational costs substantially.</p>
<p>Technology has permitted call center agents to work from home; the same technology has enabled the call center companies to appoint offshore agents. This offshore routing of calls is definitely rewarding. This is because on most occasions the business calls are being routed to developing nations. The labor charges here are really economic when compared to the same in the developed nations.</p>
<p>Not only the cost of labor but the infrastructural expenses of a web based call center also goes down. Web based, the very name suggests that most activities take place through the web. What the call center company needs to do is to provide the dispersed employees particularly the home based ones with the necessary equipments and software support. The rest of the activities are conducted via the web- starting from providing training to the employees to monitoring their performances.</p>
<p>Moreover, such <strong>virtual call center</strong>s are also ideal when the contemporary need is to cater to a global client base. That the employees belong to different time zones a prudent adjustment of the operational shifts enables the business to offer support services to the client on an all round the clock basis.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deploying an US call center is one of the most intelligent business decisions to improve the performance of the customer care department. The impeccable <strong><a title="inbound call center services" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/">inbound call center services</a></strong> can work wonders for the entire business in terms of customer retention. And such services are available against the most affordable rates.</p>
<p>Let’s see an US call center handles the customer issues?</p>
<p>• Call handling services: An efficient call handling service is the primary requirement in order to ensure that the customers get the proper and the perfect support from the business houses. Besides answering each and every incoming call, attending the calls all round the clock is very important.</p>
<p>• Helpdesk support: Mere receiving of customers is not enough on its own. To register their complains, to address their grievances and to coordinate with the concerned business department to provide the customers with the perfect service is the very intention behind call center outsourcing.</p>
<p>• Miscellaneous support services: Not only handling calls but support is provided through email other website responding service. Often hotline numbers are provided to the customers so that they can reach the business instantly.</p>
<p>• Data collection: While offering such customer support, important data and info associated with the customers are also collected. Such data can help of great help for other business processing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are certain things that customer service providers should watch out for when customers make calls. There are some customers who are genuinely interested in the client’s products/services, while there are others who just want to kill time flirting with customer service providers. The latter reason can cost companies a lot of time and expenses.</p>
<p>There are indicators that tell US call centers that customers are flirting. Flirtatious customers show a lot of interest in the client’s products/services and never show interest in going through the buying stages. When follow up is done on the lead, the customers keep saying that they need some more time to think on it or require more information, and at the same time show good interest in the products/services.</p>
<p>These customers waste the time of US call centers and their customer service providers by constantly inquiring about the products and services being marketed, but never proceeding to make any real purchase. They tend to take a lot of time trying to make purchasing decisions and keep apologizing for taking so much time and asking for more time to make decision. These customers are also the ones who leave encouraging comments on the business’ blogs but refrain from clicking on the business offers.</p>
<p>For avoiding flirts when looking for customers for businesses, <strong><a title="US call centers" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/contact-us.php">US call centers</a></strong> must have a clear picture of customers that businesses want to attract and should look for signs that tell customer service representatives that customers are flirting or not. It is important to have a good understanding of the purchasing habits of potential customers, so that call centers are not fooled by flirting customers.</p>
