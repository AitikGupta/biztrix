<p>Are you looking for a Virtual Assistant?&nbsp; As you start getting busier, you require some
help in putting your things in order. In such a case a virtual assistant will
be the best aid at your disposal. A virtual assistant can be more than a pair
of hands to get your to-do list done – they will be an extension of you and
your business, ensuring better results.</p>



<p>But when you are hiring a virtual assistant service for the
first time, you need to create a handy virtual assistant checklist that will
help you find the right virtual assistant for your needs.</p>



<p>So, what should be in your hiring first virtual assistant
checklist? Let&#8217;s find out:</p>



<h2>Hiring Your First Virtual Assistant Checklist</h2>



<h3>1. Create a list of tasks you would like your virtual
assistant to perform</h3>



<p> Listing the tasks you want your virtual assistant to perform helps you create a job description for your own reference. On the other hand, it also allows your new virtual assistant to know what is expected of him or her. Noting down tasks that are taking up your time and would be better for someone else to do is the best way to begin your checklist.</p>



<p>For example, are you spending time posting blogs and doing its social promotion? Do you want your virtual assistant to take care of the incoming call? Jot them down on the list and soon you will find a comprehensive to-do list for your future virtual assistant.</p>



<h3>2. Consider language requirements: written and spoken</h3>



<p>We all know that communication, both spoken and written are
crucial to any business. Do you expect your virtual assistant to write or
proofread letters on your behalf? Do you want them to communicate with your
clients? Are they required or expected to know another language or languages
other than English?</p>



<h3>3. Do you want your virtual assistant to work in the same time
zone as yours?</h3>



<p>Depending on your job requirements, do you want your virtual
assistant to be available when you’re awake? Are you open to the idea that they
may be from a different time zone than yours? If you’re looking for a full-time
virtual assistant service, how many hours do you consider full-time? And while
you are at it, please also decide on working hours.</p>



<h3>4. What software skills must they have to do your work?</h3>



<p>Do you need jobs to be done using a specific software? Do
virtual assistants need to possess a set of must-have skills before they meet
the requirements to apply? For example, are they required to use Microsoft PowerPoint,
Excel, Word, or Photoshop to perform their tasks? Is there any particular
software knowledge required?</p>



<h3>5. Do they meet the needs for completing a trial task?</h3>



<p>Setup a trial task from one of the tasks you have listed in
your job description and get your virtual assistant to do this. It will either
help you make sure that you are getting the right person to do the job or make
you see why a particular candidate is not up to the mark.</p>



<h3>6. Increase the reach of your virtual assistant hire
search</h3>



<p>You can find virtual assistant services through a simple search online. A number of companies offer such services. Posting it on your website and spreading the news in online communities can also help you find the ideal virtual assistant. However please be sure to mention your budget and the skills you require to get better results.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The key to success lies in time management and smart work. However, it is not always possible to find time for every small task in your day-to-day schedule. And even if you do it all, the quality of work is bound to be hampered. So, what can you do about that? Well, having a little help in hand does not harm. And that is why having an assistant is a good idea.</p>
<p>But hiring a full time assistant to take care of small tasks does not sound promising at times. Just think about the time and money you have to spend on short listing candidates, and interviewing them. And then you will also have to pay them salary and give employee benefits. Is paying so much for an assistant who will perform small tasks whenever needed justified? Fusion thinks it is a complete waste. Why pay for a full time assistant when you can hire a virtual assistant and receive professional assistance at your convenience.</p>
<p>Our virtual assistant services offer you highly skilled professionals who are at your disposal working round the clock to get your job done, no matter what it is. Virtual assistants takes care of everything from administrative tasks to social media management, website and blog maintenance and what not. Delivering your tasks on time are their first priority. But that’s just one of the perks of hiring a virtual assistant. Want to know more about the perks? Read on:</p>
<h3>Gift yourself the time to unwind</h3>
<p>Don’t you crave a break amidst tight schedules and long working hours? Everyone needs a little downtime for relaxing and rejuvenation. But you cannot achieve that with an assistant who is right beside you. You will feel the need to supervise their work or clear their doubts. But with a virtual assistant, you won’t have to supervise anything as they are highly skilled professionals who know their job and they have their superiors to make sure that you get nothing but the best output. All you need to do is to enjoy your downtime.</p>
<h3>Round the clock service</h3>
<p>Hiring an assistant burns a hole in your pockets.  Full time assistants often tend to do a poor job when you ask them to do a job urgently especially if it means they might need to stay back. Whereas, a virtual assistant is always at your service and they do not compromise on the quality. Even when the world is sleeping, your VA is always there for you.</p>
<h3>Limitless Tasks</h3>
<p>Want to have an assistant who never says ‘No’ to a task, is an all rounder and always delivers quality service on time? What if you can have all that for a small fee? Virtual assistants are the answer. They perform every task you ask for and charge a very small fee for all that. However, please remember that though they are magical workers, they won’t perform unforgivable curses (illegal or unethical tasks).</p>
<h3>Hire and Fire at will</h3>
<p>Unlike any other form of employment, you can hire or fire a VA at any given point. You pay only when you have a task on hand and hire by the hour.</p>
<h3>Office space or tools not required</h3>
<p>A Virtual Assistant does not require any workspace, working tools or any stationary; they come well equipped and perform their duties without expecting anything from you. Apart from their working cost, there is no other form of investments required.</p>
<h3>No employee benefits</h3>
<p>If you hire an assistant, you need to provide them with health benefits, provident funds, bonus and insurances. In a nutshell, you will be spending big bucks However, with a VA, you pay only for the services and not a dime more – no benefits, no incentives, nothing.</p>
<p>So, when you think about it, hiring a VA is like getting yourself a team of knowledgeable, trained and highly experienced employees at the price of one. And you never again have to worry about not getting the results.</p>
