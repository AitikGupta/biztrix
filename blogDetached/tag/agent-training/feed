								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contact center agents shoulder the great responsibility of dealing with customer service issues on a regular basis. One of the best things that a contact center Manager can do is to monitor the quality of their interactions with customers, to ensure that Agents are providing the best service possible. However, some contact centers do not take a thorough approach to shaping the best practices. So how should managers monitor for effectively?</p>
<p>At Fusion, we have adopted a few tricks to optimize the value of call quality monitoring. Here have a look:</p>
<h2>1. We take a comprehensive approach</h2>
<p>To understand agent-customer communications, it is important to monitor all the calls recorded strictly, not just auditing a random sample. Analyzing a few randomly selected calls will scarcely provide any substantial data or offer an in-depth view of agents’ performance in customer service calls.</p>
<p>Our Managers gain a comprehensive view of the calls using a speech analytics system that records all calls and monitors call quality in real-time. It also helps Managers to train Agents better and develop strategies for better customer service.</p>
<h2>2. We use the metrics but focus on our customers</h2>
<p>To offer efficient customer service, in real time, companies have to analyze average call handling time. However, many contact centers place too much emphasis on this metric. They aim for a quick call resolution that will allow Agents to move forward to the next call. While an efficient customer service is appreciated, the agents <a href="http://blogwallet.com/skimping-services-drive-away-loyal-customers/" target="_blank">should not skimp on call quality and customer service</a>. They should take as long as it needs to explain the issue to the customer so that he or she does not have to call again or contact the company via a different channel with the same problem.</p>
<p>So, at Fusion, we think it is wise to monitor all calls to see whether in the calls with lower handle time are missing out on better customer service and whether the agents with higher AHT are making an effort to resolve an issue.</p>
<h2>3. We make the agents part of the evaluation process</h2>
<p>It is always better to invite operational suggestions about a particular job from the people doing that job. At Fusion, we ask agents to give feedback regarding practices that work well for them, concerns they have about customer service calls or suggestions for writing customer service call scripts, etc. We believe that they can help contact center managers gain a broad view of how calls can be better monitored for quality.</p>
<p>However, it is also important to communicate the company’s expectations to the agents beforehand. If the agents are aware of the AHT, call quality and efficiency expected from them, they will make sure to give their best shot with a clear focus on the company’s customer service priorities.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we always remember that we can deliver excellent customer service only when out agents and managers work together with the same goal in mind. And proper call monitoring, when done right, aids us to achieve that goal.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know about the current contact center trend moving around the world? They are changing an order-taking contact center into revenue generating contact centers. They are no longer that vanilla customer service center, but something more productive and sophisticated.</p>
<p>A service call delivered in the customer care call center is the lifeline to initiate sales cycle. Contact center is making every possible effort to leverage revenue generation through the right channel.</p>
<p>In a customer call center, each call is an excellent opportunity, which if effectively leveraged can generate better sales results. Call center agent gives their full attention to the calls and resolves the query easily.</p>

<p>Potential buying traffic is diverted to contact centers for various reasons, especially for the sales opportunities. However, converting these opportunities to real revenue in the challenge.</p>
<p>Fusion has revamped the customer care service with 5 effective ways. Let us see what they are:</p>
<h3>Bringing the Change in Hiring Engine</h3>
<p>The employee recruitment process focuses on identifying, selecting and recruiting candidates who has the professional traits to handle the call within the contact centers. Some of the traits include:</p>
<p><b>Interpersonal Skills:</b> It is vital that a sales person must naturally react to people with an ability to adapt to various kinds of situations and other different personalities.</p>
<p><b>Resilience:</b> It is the way to pursue the objectives and goals with motivation and patience.</p>
<p><b>Other traits include: </b>Inspire trust, identify the critical issues in the conversation, negotiation, passion and enthusiasm, maintaining integrity.</p>
<h3>Effective Agent Training</h3>
<p>At Fusion, we believe in the motto, “<b><i>sales people are not born, they are trained</i></b>.” Yes, to us <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/agent-training-the-key-to-call-center-success.html">training is the most essential priority</a> to reinforce sales culture within a contact center itself. The contact center agent’s helps to increase up sell and cross sell and offers a new product and service. Just to provide an early version it is essential to put forward a good sales-closing question. Introduction to the domain is also an eminent way to build a confident pool so that agents could sell better. However, training is not limited to contact center agents; the team managers are also associated.</p>
<h3>Scheduling of the Calls</h3>
<p>Best agents in the contact center are kept under the notice and are deployed to attain calls at the peak hours.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we use advanced workforce management solutions that are able to forecast sales in peak hours and schedule the call handling by the best agents. With that, we have intelligent call-routing technology that prioritizes calls based on agents and customer profile. Planning and scheduling not only help to increase the chance of up sell and cross sell, but also bolsters the impetus of the agent to take care of the customers.</p>
<h3>Incentives</h3>
<p>Yes, the incentive is the key aspect to determine the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-boost-up-the-employee-happiness-meter.html">motivating factor</a> that influences sales funnel in contact centers. At Fusion, we recommend the outcome-based incentive structure for sales on high margin products and revenue generated in each transaction.</p>
<h3>Valuable Feedback</h3>
<p>Do you know the contact center agents are the strongest link with the customer? The agents inculcate sustained behavior of respecting an agent’s idea as well as the feedback.</p>
<p>These basic 5 ways allow leading contact centers to pave the smooth path for an effective customer care. We follow it to make ourselves globally exposed!</p>
