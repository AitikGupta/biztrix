								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is often essential for hospitals and the medical practitioners to look for the best medical answering service. Not just to keep their customers satisfied with the happy retreat but to make them gain  confidence on the company and their products/services.</p>
<p>When you choose a contact center who offers you with <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">medical answering service</a>, you have to consider its every potential point, like – the price charged, CSR training, 24/7 support and testimonials from the previous clients.</p>
<p>However, if you want to secure the information of your customers and you are cautious about their exchange, then make sure that the answering service you choose is <a class="zem_slink" title="Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">HIPAA</a> Compliant. This is the topmost priority, which your contact center must possess to make their answering services totally confidential and safe for your customers or patients.</p>
<h3>HIPAA &#8211; What is it?</h3>
<p>Came into action by the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3103.ENR:" target="_blank">Congress in 1996</a>, HIPAA or the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act. It was established to protect every patient’s privacy and to make sure that the patients’ files never get shared with another party without the patient&#8217;s consent, preferably written consent. If your business deals with patients, then you have to activate the medical answering service and make sure that the contact center who disburses such service are HIPAA compliant.</p>
<h3>What Should You Look In A Medical Answering Service?</h3>
<p>You have to make sure that the answering service provider is in full compliance with HIPAA. Fusion and their customer representatives have completed the appropriate training to meet all kinds of regulations. Our agents attend regular training and workshops in order to stay on the top of any new <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/index.html" target="_blank">HIPAA regulations</a>. We also take care while training each CSR on how to deal with patients on the phone, when they discuss the information, which are extremely personal. CSRs have to be sensitive and reassure that the caller and his information remain secure in our hand.</p>
<p>You also have to check that the contact center and their staff are not just answering the phone call of the patients but helping patients with health information. Make sure that the contact centers give them the proper training. Check with the vendor that the data is stored, and they have a disaster security and recovery system to restrict the potential hackers or any kind of system failures.</p>
<p>We update out our answering service technology at Fusion, since being the leader in BPO services, we know regular updates can prevent the future errors.</p>
<h3>Security Measures</h3>
<p>An answering service must possess some other things so that they can ensure that the patient’s information and data are safe in their hand. Go through this following list to know what the leading contact center can offer you through the answering service. Make sure you choose a contact center who is HIPAA Compliant.</p>
<ol>
<li>Protected email portals</li>
<li>Having fax covers that include privacy statements</li>
<li>No visitors allowed in the secured areas</li>
<li>Secure systems installed to dispose medical data</li>
<li>System to hide the information to those who walk by</li>
</ol>
<p>Fusion implements all these rules at the contact center to give the real retreat to their customers, as well as their business clients.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sales are needed by ever business and to do so, orders must be placed. In order to place orders an answering service must always be available to them. In the old days people were only able to buy what they want during regular working hours. The most forward thinking companies enabled telephone ordering. But in this Net savvy age orders can be placed through the Internet as well. An online order taking services business is meant to help increase a company&#8217;s sales</p>
<p>With the growing number of advertisements pushing products at customers worldwide, an online order taking service is necessary to take all those orders. These services enable customers and potential customers to buy what they want when they need it. This is a kind of 24 hour answering service available to customers.</p>
<p>Online <strong><a title="order taking services" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/order-taking.html">order taking services</a></strong> acknowledge the value of data privacy and that is why they work hard to keep your information private and secure. Credit card processing is part and parcel of the services offered by an online order taking service centre regardless of where the call center is located.</p>
<p>An online order taking services business does much more than take an order. They also represent your company by answering the queries of prospective and present customers. Once an advertisement or commercial is aired or seen, many potential customers will call, email or visit the company&#8217;s website for more information.</p>
<p>Providing online order taking service might be warmly welcomed by customers because it is convenient and fast but keep in mind that not every and each customer has constant connection to the Internet.</p>
<p>But almost every household has a phone in it. This is why order taking answering services enjoys more popularity. Sometimes all customers want is to be able to talk with human representatives to clear any last minute doubts or obtain further information before ordering for any product or service. In such cases, they prefer order taking answering services.</p>
<p>For this reason most businesses offer a combination of online order taking services and order taking answering services.</p>

The hidden potentials of such a phone answering service to make the buying experience smoother for the 21<sup>st</sup> century clients are yet to be realized by many. But it has been pointed out by experts that such an outsourcing can work in the interest of business in terms of increased revenue. Let’s see how and why.</p>
<p>Training of the responsible executives: Even the customer care representatives who are in charge of the order taking <strong><a title="answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">answering service</a></strong> have to have a thorough knowledge of the business products or services. Such knowledge is necessary to clear the last moment doubts of the customers. Order taking is an important business department indeed; this is the ultimate step when the sales leads are qualified into paying customers. Often scripts are provided to the agents to make them sound more confident but it is necessary to be lively and spontaneous at the same time. And here in the pre campaign briefings of the customer care agents by the business turns out to be helpful.</p>
<p>Documentation of the orders: Merely taking down the orders might appear to be really easy, but while taking care of such a monotonous job it often gets difficult to be flawless. This is exactly the reason why the responsible agents are advised to document the orders and repeat the same to cross check with the customers. Again it is their duty to process the orders to the concerned business department and even to ensure that they are dispatched as well as delivered bang on time. On time delivery of orders speaks good about the business or the brand.</p>
<p>Gather customer feedback: Feedbacks are of immense important when conducting business affairs. More than often the responsibility is on the outsourced customer care agents to gather valuable feedbacks about the business.</p>

But the recent trend is that of outsourcing. let us have a look at the reasons that makes outsourcing look so alluring.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2663.png" alt="♣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> When the existing staffs of the medical care units fail to fulfill the call handling duties, outsourcing is the only option. The staffs cannot be blamed for such inability. They are already over worked and are too much bind up with other duties that are equally important if not more. Trying to dedicate more amount of time to the call handling services might have a negative impact on the other duties assigned to them. That is the performance of the medical care unit is to suffer anyway.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2663.png" alt="♣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> When the business does not have the adequate amount of funds at its disposal to give shape to the plans of in-sourcing. The process of in-sourcing is rather expensive and at the same time becomes a crucial concern. It is very obvious that establishing a whole new answering service set up needs a good bit of time as well as money. More than the infrastructure, the recruitment process eats up the maximum time.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2663.png" alt="♣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The situation might very well be so that the medical facility has the funds to finance in-sourcing but they do not consider the same to be lucrative. At the end of the day the health care units are driven by profit earning motives.</p>

The numbers might also be provided on offline paper forms at stores and restaurants, which needs to be verified. Telephone answering service agents need to learn if the phone numbers are existent and working. The name of the owner of the number must also match with the name provided on the online or offline business form.</p>
<p>The main purpose of having this phone verification is to authenticate the credential of the individuals. Phone verification is a must for banking sectors, credit card issuers, as well as for ID proof; these firms hire telephone answering service call center for verifying the phone numbers. Phone verification is also seen as a way to decrease several unproductive calls by tele-callers considerably.</p>
<p><strong>How does the IVR system work in this case?</strong></p>
<p>When prospects enter phone numbers on the online and offline registration forms, they are provided a number that they have to dial from the number they have provided on the form. As soon as the phone rings, the call is disconnected and the Caller ID is captured without charging the caller for the call. The Caller ID is then matched with the phone number provided in the form. This enables the verification of the phone number and the registration will also be accepted.</p>
