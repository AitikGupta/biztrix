<p>Gitomer in his book claims that the brands aiming for customer satisfaction clearly has the wrong goal in mind. Instead of aiming for customer satisfaction they should be aiming for customer loyalty. It’s potentially beneficial to the brand as it helps them retain their customers and turns them into brand advocates.  The result? More business.This book brings you some simple methods in achieving customer loyalty.</p>
<p>And now it is time for an old classic –</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Dale Carnegie<br />
<strong>Twitter: </strong>N/A<br />
<strong>When to Read?</strong> – Anytime is a good time</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6183" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People.jpg" alt="How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People Paperback by Dale Carnegie" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Although this book is on dealing with other people is a must-read for anyone in a customer service role. Carnegie’s insights on what drives people and how to use that to make them happy and get what you want are still as relevant as they were in 1937.</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
