<p>You have all heard about <em>Powerpuff Girls</em> and how they are made of sugar &amp; spice and all things nice and an accidental dose of chemical X. Without that chemical X or X factor, they would become powerless.  The same thing applies for excellent customer service.  No matter how you incorporate the latest technology, metrics, and communication channels to provide the best customer service through your contact center, it will be quite useless without the factor X – your agents. </p>



<p>The agents are often the unsung heroes of customer service.
They work as the first point of contact for your customers and therefore has
the power to build or ruin a customer experience. According to a study,
companies with engaged employees outperform those without by up to <a href="https://www.business2community.com/business-innovation/remote-workforce-nps-important-metric-youre-missing-01785305#oWRIA4bsxOwz6011.97">202%</a>.
Want to deliver excellent customer experience every single time?&nbsp; Turn your attention to engaging your agents. </p>

<p>At Fusion, we take agent engagement very seriously and
perform various activities to keep our agents engaged, encouraged and
empowered. Here are a few agent engagement tips that Fusion regularly uses to
keep the agents engaged:</p>



<h3>1. A Sincere thanks </h3>



<p>A little thank you can go a long way. After a successful
campaign or an exhaustive week, a thank you can pick the agents up like nothing
else. We recommend that every manager must have it in their arsenal and use it
regularly.</p>



<h3>2. Training</h3>



<p>The training and orientation program at the beginning of an
agent’s tenure in your organization is often exhaustive.&nbsp; There’s a lot to take in within a short
period. Therefore, some agents tend not to remember each and everything taught
at the initial training.&nbsp; To fix this,
Fusion arranges custom training for them that help them catch up and improve
their performance. </p>



<p>Fusion also arranges cross-trainings with a goal of
increasing employee knowledge. We have them trained in other departments or
positions, help them learn new skills and languages.&nbsp; It provides a sense of value to an employee
and puts them on a fast track for improvement.</p>



<h3>3. Offsite events </h3>



<p>Everyone needs to break their mundane cycle and let their
hair down every once in a while. And that is exactly what your agents need.
Take the team out of the office and have some fun. Take them on a picnic, a
happy hour, an after-office badminton session, or a football tournament. Allow
them to have fun and enjoy each other’s company. Your team deserves this. </p>



<h3>4. Communicate
expectations and reward the efforts</h3>



<p>As the old saying goes – “<em>Tell me and I forget; show me and I remember; involve me and I understand</em>” you need to involve your agents and show them the big picture.  This way, the agents will know what is expected from them and how they can drive the company towards success. And when they meet that expectation, do not forget to recognize their efforts, encourage them, and reward them. This means the world to them. </p>



<h3>5. Reward and
recognitions</h3>



<p>Provide incentives and praise. It really shows agents how
much the organization respects and values them and their critical role. This
way you will inspire agents to keep doing the kinds of things that increase
customer satisfaction and boost customer experience. </p>



<p>Also, your reward should not come in the form of a cupcake,
pizza, and balloons.&nbsp; They do not quite
convey the message that you value your agents. Fusion has a few suggestions: </p>



<ul><li>A Wall of Fame featuring agents who have achieved excellence in key areas last month</li><li>A points-for-performance program, where agents who excel receive points that can be redeemed for merchandise</li><li>Peer recognition such as “<em>You rock!</em>” stickers or a pack of chocolates to peers who show outstanding effort in making a customer happy. </li><li>Honoring agents during Customer Service Week, and other such recognition.</li><li>Rewarding the best performers quarterly in a small ceremony where the CEO congratulates them can be great.</li></ul>



<h3>6. Ask for agent
feedback</h3>



<p>You must make your agents feel valued and heard.&nbsp; Therefore, you need to ask for their opinion,
suggestions, and feedbacks. This also has other advantages. Often agents can
notice common issues and come up with easy solutions. Their feedback can help
your business resolve underlying issues.&nbsp;
All employees need to feel valued and believe they have a say in the
future of the business. 

These are a few tried and true agent engagement
tips that Fusion has put to work with brilliant results.&nbsp; Do you have such tips? Share with us in the

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Fusion BPO, we have armed our business with trained sales representatives for different telemarketing campaigns. Our sales reps are savvy enough to handle both inbound and outbound process.</p>
<p>In spite of sales being a rewarding and challenging job, we achieved higher goals with our team members. Often clients and market influencers asks us how we have achieved this parity in our business transactions? We say we follow the “seven principles learnt in seven days.”</p>
<h3>What Do Sales Reps Represents?</h3>
<p>A sales representative needs some special skills to crack a deal. He or she has to sell the service or the product, not by pushing rather growing interest among the buyers. In most cases, you come to know that the salaries of sales people are poor. Since, companies reward them with high commissions based on work productivity.</p>
<p>For which, the products are little expensive. However, these sales commissions serve as the incentive for the sales people to work harder.</p>
<p>Fusion BPO knows how hard it is to find effective sales representatives. However, experts must know that you do not need to find reps rather you need to train them. Fusion trains their sales team at regular intervals to achieve a ‘BINGO’ in marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Let Fusion BPO share seven tips to train sales representative effectively, just in 7 days.</p>
<h3>Day 1: Be Positive</h3>
<p>In the first day, trainers must impart the idea <strong><em>to be positive in attitude</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Have the right frame of mind, a big point that a sales reps must possess. There are sale reps who get discouraged as soon as a customer refuses or drops down the cold calls. They take up sales process as difficult. You need to overcome pessimism and turn positive to become a great sales rep.</p>
<p>For further reference check out this <a href="http://www.customerservicegroup.com/tccsample/TCC120112sample.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>: <strong>A Positive Learning Attitude, Boosts Your Skills and Performance</strong></p>
<h3>Day 2: Be Sociable</h3>
<p>As soon as sales reps grows positive attitude, trainer must proceed onto the next lesson, <strong><em>to become sociable and friendly.</em></strong></p>
<p>To be amiable and friendly is the greatest quality that sales reps of today must possess. Being sociable will help the sales people to be open and upbeat so that they can manage any kind of marketing campaign.</p>
<h3>Day 3: Be Proactive</h3>
<p>The trainers must <strong><em>turn their members open and proactive</em></strong> on the third day, as soon as reps learnt their lesson of friendly interactions.</p>
<p>Sales reps should be people oriented. The sales person must grow the ability to foster a personal approach in every call. One should make calls in a manner so that the customers take him or her as a problems solvers and shares their interest and disinterest on the particular product/service they are going to buy.</p>
<p>Browse this <a href="http://www.callcentrehelper.com/how-contact-centres-can-become-more-proactive-36815.htm" target="_blank">article</a> from CallCenterHelper to see: <strong>How Can Contact Centers become Proactive</strong></p>
<h3>Day 4: Be Honest</h3>
<p>On day four, trainers must ask their trainee reps <strong><em>to be honest and maintain the integrity</em></strong>. Why do they need it?</p>
<p>Honesty and integrity are the cornerstones of maintaining long-term customer relationship. Sales are always about building good relationship, solely based on trust. If you look at the market, trust cannot even grow without honesty and integrity. Therefore, both go hand-in-hand.</p>
<h3>Day 5: Restore Patience</h3>
<p>Biggest lesson a trainer has to impart on the fifth day is <strong><em>to be patient.</em></strong></p>
<p>It is possible that the customer will not entertain the telemarketing calls. There are several ways of refusal. At times, agent might lose patience while convincing an irate or a prospective customer. However, sales reps must be patient and should take time to build a relationship with every customer (both irate and interested).</p>
<h3>Day 6: Be Knowledgeable About the Sales Process</h3>
<p>Trainer must <strong><em>impart details on the products/services</em></strong> the reps are going to sell in a different set of marketing campaigns on the sixth day.</p>
<p>Sales reps should have deep knowledge on the sales process and skills in order to become a qualified sales representative. The reps must identify the prospects, know the protocols of the sales process and find legal ways to shorten them for the convenience of the customers. Sales reps must be familiar with the benefits of the products/services that he sells.</p>
<h3>Day 7: Know Your Customers</h3>
<p>The last and the absolute lesson a trainer must teach their representatives in the last day is <strong><em>to know their customers from scratches.</em></strong></p>
<p>Knowing the customers from scratches helps to build an effective relationship. Next, representatives need to follow-up. Yes, even after closing the deals one has to provide quality service to the customers by actively assisting then with after-sales support.</p>
<p>Fusion BPO Services shared the popular seven training tactics to help call center experts in training their sales representatives effectively. To have future prospects in sales process, and to establish long-term customer relationship impart these 7 principles to your sales reps today!!!</p>
