								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2015, businesses faced a whole new challenge – to meet the ever increasing expectation level of their customers. The tech-savvy customers want to have the best customer experience that can only be delivered through a multi-lingual, multi-channel contact center.</p>
<p>However, it is difficult for small and medium sized businesses find it difficult to fit an in-house, multilingual, multichannel contact center into their budget. For them, it is easier to opt for call center outsourcing (CCO).  The call center outsourcing industry is changing at a rapid pace to deliver the optimum level of customer experience.</p>
<p>Here are six predictions for key trends that will shape the CCO industry in 2015 and beyond.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong> Business Process Improvement (BPI)</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Business Process Improvement (BPI) will continue to build the industry and act as a driving factor in the field of BPO and call center services.  An increasing number of companies have begun to realize that just transferring their processes to a third-party call center services provider is not enough. That is where   BPI comes into the scene.</p>
<p>BPI intends to offer improvements in business processes in terms of quality, speed, cost, as well as flexibility.  It also aims to build the capacity required for constant improvement. BPI allows BPOs to analyze the client processes in hand, in order to recognize scopes for enhancement in the quality and/or quantity of output.</p>
<p>It also assists in creating training aids aiming to bridge any gaps in skill levels, implementing necessary technology enhancements (if any), and mapping out the processes required to accomplish desired results.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong> Customer Journey and Customer Experience Will Gain Importance </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Previously, businesses used to evaluate call center outsourcing vendors simply based on their low-cost ability.  But today, BPOs are evaluated on their strategic ability to contribute to the customer journey and customer experience.</p>
<p>This has shifted the focus of businesses from the search for a low-cost basic customer care provider to a more tactical form of outsourcing. The day has come when third-party call centers will be no longer considered as an executants and act as a strategic partner and brand ambassador to their clients’ business.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>Multichannel in the Way to Go</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Customers today wants prompt support from businesses round the clock, via different communication channels.  In fact &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 30% of customer service engagements today are attributed to communication channels other than phone (<a href="http://cfigroup.com/resources/white-papers/call-center-satisfaction-index-2012-ccsi" target="_blank">CFI Group</a>).</li>
<li>Businesses that follow a multichannel customer care strategy accomplish more than double (9.7% instead of 3.9%) year-over-year improvements in customer satisfaction (<a href="http://aberdeen.com/research/7006/ra-multi-channel-contact-center/content.aspx" target="_blank">Aberdeen Group Inc.</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Delivering a true multichannel strategy can be a little challenging for many businesses.  However, contact centers aim to offer a comprehensive multichannel customer care strategy to their clients.</p>
<p>To deliver the swift and flawless experience a customer demands for, many have opted for live chat and social customer service and considered them as the next big thing in the field of customer service. Many third-party contact center service providers have already started offering these as services.  In future, one can expect to see more and more BPOs following the suit.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong> Sourcing and Developing the Right Talent</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Third party contact centers are known for supplying the right person with the right skill for the right job. This gives the call center services providers a huge competitive advantage.  However, depending on clients’ business, the number of agents and necessary skills vary far and wide.  After all, it is all about delivering an efficient customer experience.</p>
<p>For example, consumers today prefer doing business with a brand that offers customer service in their native language. According to a 2011 study by the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_313_en.pdf" target="_blank">European Commission</a>, 42% of consumers never buy products and services in other languages. Therefore, in order to satisfy the multichannel as well as the multilingual needs of its clients, a BPO has to have a large talent pool who can deliver optimum customer experience.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Industry Specialization </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Industry specialization is sure to become a pre-requisite for opting for a call center outsourcing partner in near future. When a business opts for an outsourcing partner who has extensive experience in offering customer service for the particular industry the client is serving, it will be better suited to deal with the common issues and challenges.</p>
<p>Businesses will increasingly become more interested in partnering with a vendor with industry expertise than a basic contact center service provider. Vendors with a deep expertise are far more likely to overcome challenges and deliver state-of-the-art customer experience.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a new debutante will not be able to deal with issues and challenges.  As a result, there’s a high possibility of losing time, money, and effort, over poor customer satisfaction. And, standing today, nobody wants that to happen.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong> Near-shore Locations </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For a long time now businesses were torn between outsourcing customer service within the USA and off-shoring the same to another low cost service provider. Today, there’s a third but feasible option – near-shore call center service provider.</p>
<p>This will allow businesses in the United States to outsource their call center services to different Latin American or Central American country such as Chile, <a href="http://www.ocurrance.com/spanish-call-center.html" target="_blank">El Salvador</a>, etc. These countries have made a name in the field of customer service with their multichannel, multilingual and state-of-the-art service offering.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Entrepreneurs look down at outsourcing as a strategy for the big businesses. Now, beside the <i>Big Daddies</i> of business, technology is developing accessible tools for the small business owners. For smaller firms, outsourcing is creating bigger impact and bigger profits just like the big businesses.</p>
<p>More number of small businesses are interested in outsourcing their task. For them the outsourcing partners have moved a step ahead to compel the professionals to work from anywhere. These have reduced the overhead costs, payroll taxes, health insurance, workers compensations, space constrictions that the small business owners might need to provide, if they maintained an in-house call center.</p>
<p>There are a number of successful corporations, which are using the outsourcing services for years. <i>Why they outsource?</i> These successful business organizations have witnessed that certain aspect of the business, like outsourcing is no longer cost inefficient. Maintaining an in-house contact center team is not going to give them a competitive advantage that an outsourcing partner can give.</p>
<p>Just like other leading outsourcing companies, Fusion is actively rendering call center services to a number of small businesses, and allowing them to touch the biggest profit margins.</p>
<p>The organizations are happy to refocus their resources to the contact centers. Organizations also think that those resources are now efficiently used and perform the tasks profitably just like their in-house members. Now with profitability they have sledged the overhead expenses. So now, profit comes with savings.</p>
<h3>Macro Approach towards Business with the Help of Outsourcing</h3>
<p>Well, outsourcing allows a macro view of the business and generates profit so that you are able to employ resources in a way that generates profit.</p>
<p>Take for example, Ford purchases $300 million in supplies per month from approximately 200 vendors. Among them, they use 150,000 parts every month from the outside vendors.</p>
<p>Why do you think that it has happened? &#8211;  Is it because Ford does not have the ability to manufacture the automobile parts? Actually, they own some of the largest vendors. Ford could buy any vendor at any time. However, they restrain from doing so, because it would be inefficient to own all the aspects of the supply chain. Ford thinks not to waste the limited resources stamping out the parts, which they cannot manufacture with fullest efficiency.</p>
<h3>How Will You Relate This Example To Small Business And Outsourcing?</h3>
<p>It’s simple. Outsourcing is the perfect gel for the small business owners beside the business giants. When you think to leverage your business to outsourcing services, it means you will get ample of time to focus on the core business aspects.  All these aspects indicate, solutions and perfection just like the bigger businesses.</p>
<p>With the help of contact center representative, the small business owner can &#8211; save their time, get better prospects, retain the customer service to a higher level and meet out all the essential aspects of a big organization.</p>
<p>Whether the business is large or small, the core business function is closing business. Prospecting is just the input to synchronize the signing deals.  At every time, business uses the inputs to get the better outputs. More efficiently, the small business uses the resource, the more profitable it becomes.</p>
<p>So it is a question to all small business owners – <i>Will You Like to Build and Sell a Lexus or You Will Like to Concentrate on Your Efforts to Design the Tail Light?</i> If you are ready to take the business to the next level, then prepare to take the tail light into the assembly line.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Customer-care-agents.jpg" rel="&quot;lightbox&quot;&quot;"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4554" title="customer service providers" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Customer-care-agents-300x230.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Customer-care-agents-300x230.jpg 300w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Customer-care-agents.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>It is imperative to figure out whether your <strong><a title="customer service providers" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/">customer service providers</a></strong> are competent enough or not. Call center outsourcing to be precise appointing a call center service provider is a business decision that cannot be taken in haste. Coming to how to assess the potentials of the service providers, here are a few points that need to be taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>The quality of the service</strong>: This is definitely the most important concern while outsourcing. And to figure out- well having a look at the past performance records is an option, having a word with the past clients might also help but the best way is to ask for live demonstrations even for free trails of services.</p>
<p>The nest important concern is the pricing of the services. Under the prevailing marketing conditions one of the main motives of call center outsourcing is cost cutting. Hence it is necessary to develop a fair enough idea of the outsourced call center pricing. And for the purpose you need to inquire about the two aspects of pricing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How do the service providers charge</strong>? Payments can be made on per call basis or per minute basis. However, it is the latter that is considered to be a more reasonable option. But at the end of the day it is the specific business needs and requirements that have the ultimate bearing on the decision as to which pricing arrangement to opt for.</li>
<li><strong>What is the exact billing cycle</strong>? It is always recommended to go for simple and straight forward monthly billing. The 28 days billing period as followed by many call center companies is often very illusive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing your business enterprise needs to ensure is that the contract can be terminated at any point of time.</p>

To be truer, the Indian and the Philippines call centers were besieged by the Obama government’s decision to restrict outsourcing of business processes to the offshore lands half way across the globes.<br />
But the US based business houses didn’t take much time to realize that such a government decision can have grave implications on the businesses as well as on the overall US economy. The rationale behind such a decision was to stop the migration of the job opportunities from the US to the less developed nations of the Asian continent.<br />
Although the government’s decision to evade taxes to give a boost to the development of the domestic call center businesses also did not help much. The argument was such that the US call center companies can never be as economic as the offshore call center service providers. This is because of the labor charges in these two parts of the world are beyond comparison. The less employment opportunities and the resultant abundance of labor supply has reduced the labor rates in the third world nations to such an extent that the weekly labor charges of the US agents are often higher than the monthly charges of the Indian or the Filipino agents. The good point is that the cost of labor does not have any negative impact whatsoever on the productivity.<br />
Now that recession has lost its old sting, outsourcing to the far away lands have become a lucrative (that it was always) and popular business strategy all over again.</p>

What makes the outsourced call centers so efficient in handling the marketing campaigns? Well it is the training they receive. And it is the trained agents solely that makes <strong><a title="call center outsourcing" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/ ">call center outsourcing</a></strong> such a rewarding option for the business firms.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at the various components of the training that are being organized in order to impart the agents with the required skills.</p>
<ul>
<li>As it has already been mentioned the primary aim of such training is to develop the necessary skills in the telemarketers and to enlighten them about the call center software and techniques. Also they are briefed about the market conditions as well as the various basic techniques of alluring targets.</li>
<li>How are these skills generated? Well they are made to handle sample calls and they are judged on the basis of how they handle the same. The first and foremost requirement is to be polite and maintain the cool no matter what the customer behavior is like.</li>
<li>Another important part of the training is that it teaches the agents as to how to handle customer rejections. It is not possible for the telemarketers to turn each and every sales call into an actual sales figure. Even one particular lead to be converted into sales needs a lot of follow up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides such training what becomes necessary on the part of the business investors is to arrange for pre campaign briefing sessions. These sessions are the best way to provide the external telemarketers with the relevant product or service information. Without such information a productive marketing strategy cannot be formulated.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Call centers have been set up all across the globe and businesses have become dependent on them, yet many incorrect ideas about call centers have popped up that just refuse to go away. In order to properly appreciate the operation and utilization of call centers it is important that these myths are completely discarded. Given below are some widespread call center myths that should be immediately discarded:</p>
<p>Though statistics play a vital role in the operation of call centers, it is the quality of work that determines their true value. The size, reach and manpower of a call center may speak a lot about its success but when it comes to its utilization for a particular company it is the way it caters to the specific needs of the company and the kind of relationship it is able to establish with the customers that really matters.</p>
<p>Call center agents are asked to use the opportunity of interaction with the customer to make a sale. This apparently shrewd business strategy has been criticized and said to undermine the quality of services but if understood in the right perspective the process is beneficial to all the parties involved.</p>
<p>Certain organizations, in their attempt to retain control over customers, regard their products to be too complicated to be delivered by a call center. They fail to understand that customers can be served through different sales channels and call center could be one of them. When investing in call center outsourcing, they do not treat call center employees at par with your own sales employees.</p>
<p>The concept that <strong><a title="call centers" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/call-center.html">call center</a></strong> performance levels are always recorded is widely prevalent but the fact is that there is no set measure of optimum productivity with regard to the speed, volume or quality of call. Some customers would say that they prefer a quick solution to their problem while others would bet on the service experience. However, these two aspects of speed and quality are not contradictory to each other.</p>
<p>Lastly, people believe that by investing in call center services, they have at their services call centers that merely make and receive calls; this is an erroneous notion that still persists among certain sections when call centers have evolved to so much more.</p>

In-house efforts, when the business can afford is the best way to deal with the help desk services. But the tough market conditions do no permit the business enterprises these days to invest the adequate time and energy on such issues. Call center outsourcing becomes the inevitable option then.</p>
<p>Let us figure out under what circumstances such outsourcing turns out to be rewarding:</p>
<p>• When the business enterprises cannot afford in-house help desk services. The wide and extensive global clientele base these days demands various modern gadgets to be used for the help desk services. These equipments are no wonder pretty expensive and also in order to use them expert personnel is needed. Not many contemporary business enterprises particularly the new and the small ones can afford such expenses.</p>
<p>• When the products or services of the business enterprise is not that complicated, when the external agents can be provided with an in-depth product knowledge very easily, when the customer questions and problems are pretty common- help desk outsourcing saves the in-house employees from a monotonous job.</p>
<p>• Again when the incoming call volume to the business is quite high it becomes impossible for the in-house employees to handle each and every call with efficiency. But the inability to attend one single business call might cost the business quite a few thousand dollars. Outsourcing in order to reap the benefits of a prompt answering service is a prudent decision.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="&quot;lightbox&quot;&quot;" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Social-Media-for-CRM.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4500" title="customer service providers" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Social-Media-for-CRM-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Social-Media-for-CRM-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Social-Media-for-CRM-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Social-Media-for-CRM.jpg 309w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Call center outsourcing undoubtedly is a profitable deal given the time and the condition is ideal. It must be borne in mind by the business enterprises that deploying a third party is only a business need and not any luxury. Such a business decision rather strategy is to be adopted only when it is needed. Outsourcing just for the heck of it is definitely not going to do any good.</p>
<p>But the common question is how to determine the ideal time and how to figure out whether your business needs external help or not. Here are a few tips.</p>
<p>•When the business budget, the manpower and most importantly the market condition does not permit rather makes the in-house endeavors insufficient, outsourcing remains the most convenient and economic option. In fact for small and relatively newer ventures it is the only choice, the larger firms still has the option to invest on the in-house efforts. However, the cost effectiveness and the productivity of the call center outsourcing are proven once and for all no matter whatever is the current market situation.</p>
<p>•Market condition as we had already touched upon is another determining factor. The prevailing economic climate makes outsourcing an inevitable business strategy rather than an occasional necessity. In fact without an external help it will be impossible to break the shackle of recession.</p>
<p>•Again when the aim is quality service and effective discharge of peripheral business duties resorting to a specialized service provider makes sense. It is a proven fact that no one deals with the customer issues better than the experienced <strong><a title="customer service providers" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/">customer service providers</a></strong>. Same goes for telemarketing outsourcing.</p>
<p>•Again, when time is a crucial factor the call center companies with ready infrastructure and trained staffs becomes the best solutions.</p>

Such a step is to ensure that the telemarketing endeavors of the business reap the desired fruits. Ever thought what would be the ideal outsourcing destination in case you contemplate to deploy a third party to take care of your telemarketing campaigns? Well recent market trends suggest that India has become the most cherished <strong><a title="call center outsourcing" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/">call center outsourcing</a></strong> destination.</p>
<p>Why such preference? Yes there are reasons behind it and lets have a look at those.</p>
<p>India is one of the developing countries; the economy is looking for avenues to kick start the process of growth. And the ever increasing population of the country is in the look out for job opportunities. Hence both the government incentives as well as the population make the whole atmosphere conducive for the growth of a booming call center industry. Going by the laws of classical economics the abundance of labor supply brings down the labor cost significantly. This reduces the overall operational expenses of the Indian call centers.</p>
<p>However, these reduced operational costs in no ways affect the quality of services. In fact to assess the outcomes of cold calling campaigns onsite monitor is appointed to collect valuable feedbacks from the field and send it back to the workstation. Such feedback is crucial if the errors in the approach are to be corrected.</p>
<p>Another factor that works in favor of the Indian call centers is the time zone to which the country belongs. Two or three operational shifts by the agents and all round support services can be provided to the global clientele base on behalf of the business.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the call center industry in India has emerged as a savior for the US business firms.</p>
