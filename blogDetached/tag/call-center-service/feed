Nearly half of the US business enterprises outsource to Indian call centers. And it is particularly the <strong><a title="telemarketing in India" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/">telemarketing in India</a></strong> that has flourished like anything.</p>
<p>Given the efficiency and the inexpensiveness of the service, the responsibility of telemarketing can be blindly entrusted on any Indian call centers. And your company can experience rapid growth from such telemarketing endeavors put in by an eminent call center service provider.</p>
<p>Besides being the champions in telemarketing, Indian call centers are beneficial form other aspects too:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2666.png" alt="♦" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Money is a factor. Because labor in India is pretty cheap when compared to the US labor rates, this brings down the overall operational costs substantially.</p>

The time difference with US is of exact 12 hours. This turns out to be really convenient in conducting the telemarketing campaigns. Also telemarketing in India is conducted in two- or three shift operations only to ensure that such campaign runs 24/7.</p>
