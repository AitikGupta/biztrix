								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent survey on the upcoming communication channel for the contact centers by <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/aberdeen-mltichnnl-contact-ctr-1902157.pdf" target="_blank">Aberdeen Group</a>, it has been clearly shown that the contact center trend is going to face a massive change in the year 2013.</p>
<p>It’s the month of April and financial year of 2013 has begun. So it&#8217;s natural that the contact centers are <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/call-center-outsourcing-become-more-efficient.html">going to invest</a> a lot in their infrastructure to boost their ROI.</p>
<p>Even at Fusion, we are witnessing large shifts in our call center premises. Here, we are going to discuss the current trend that most of the leading contact center are going to follow in the upcoming months.</p>
<h3>1) Emotional Analysis Of The Callers</h3>
<p>One of the crucial trends and this one truly needs a specific mention. What we see is that all the contact centers prioritize callers according to their emotional meter – how heated up or angry they are while making the call. This method is internationally accepted as it is able to determine the positive impact on the caller and the KPI (<a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-technologies-boost-up-the-kpi.html">Key Performance Indicators</a>). It is one of the automated ways to analyze the caller’s emotional status by taking into various factors like – pitch, timbre, tone etc.</p>
<h3>2) Social Networking</h3>
<p>Phone calls are prevalent but with the influx of the new communication channel like social media contacting the call centers have become easy. People have started to communicate via e-mails and other such devices like web/chat, instant messaging etc. More customer service channel means added burden, but the arrival of social media has changed the scenario a bit. Consumers across the world are using social media to do research on the product, express their opinion, influences the brand and reaches out to the companies. So, agents can easily <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/social-customer-services-personalize-customer-support.html">communicate with customers via social channels</a>.</p>
<h3>3) Internalized Customer Records</h3>
<p>As the demand for the personalized services has increased, so caller friendly services are getting popular. <em>Contact center companies</em> like Fusion do not hesitate to walk that extra mile to gain access to the customers and get customer’s full history before beginning the conversation through any channel. It is also applicable that companies like to have a formalized business approach to manage the social inquiries. At Fusion, we maintain it and shift the duty to customer service departments, thus sparing the marketing departments from taking the extra responsibility.</p>
<h3>4) Virtual Assistant</h3>
<p>Another significant trend that is predominantly used by the call centers is a virtual assistant. Bridging the gap between web and contact centers has always been the modus operandi of all the BPO companies. This was never an easy task to accomplish, but virtual employees and their contribution have changed it a lot. With the use of different channel, it becomes easy to support the customers by interactions. Innovative technologies also has a large role to play in this respect. The virtual assistant has taken a new turn with the implementation of technologies like text recognition and speech generation technologies.</p>
<h3>5) Cloud Computing</h3>
<p>Cloud computing world in going to increase by fourfold and will reach  all time record $150 billion. This vital statistic shows that the contact centers are going to feel the change in their processes with the use of cloud in this year. At Fusion, they help to maintain the right balance between traditional on premise resilience and offer the flexibility of state-of-the-art cloud enabled technologies.</p>
<p>Fusion has thought to move with the trend, and thus retain the leading position in BPO industry. Therefore, try to be the next generation call center with the use of current contact center trends today!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a part of prestigious contact center management, we understand that the job is not something for the weak at heart. Dealing with everyday problems is the basic task of the outsourcing companies. Maybe at times, you have to deal with the multiple stakeholders. Satisfying customers, clients and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-boost-up-the-employee-happiness-meter.html">employees</a> are measurable tasks. It leaves the contact center management stressed and pressured.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is must for the contact center managers and team leaders to reduce their tension and run a high-performance operation. How to maintaining the both minimize tension and accelerate the performance?</p>
<p>What may be essential to achieve this target? &#8211; Building up of the leadership culture is essential for achieving this target.</p>
<h3><strong>What is the Leadership Culture?</strong></h3>
<p>According to a survey by <a href="http://www.ccl.org/leadership/pdf/solutions/TYO.pdf" target="_blank">Center for Creative Leadership</a>, creating a leadership culture is necessary not only for managers and team leaders, but the agents also must agree. They must comply with the 5 key indicators &#8211; <strong>communication</strong>, <strong>principles of ownership</strong>, <strong>planning</strong>, <strong>action and partnership</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Communication</strong></h3>
<p>Make sure that you communicate clearly, when you give an instruction or make a request, do give a proper justification to support your statement. Pick the phone whenever needed, and write down the interpretation of the conversation, as everyone perceives conversations in a different manner. This scribbling down of the conversation will give you clarification of understanding.</p>
<p>Use “we” instead of “I” or “you”.  This helps to remove the defensiveness and potential feelings of blame while talking to a customer.</p>
<h3><strong>Principles of Ownership</strong></h3>
<p>Being a contact center manager if you find some action item is associated with your name, and then own it. If the item is valuable, then follow-up, unless leadership directs you in other way.</p>
<p>Ask people: “How may I help you?”, when you think to deal with them. Remember: a leader also serves!</p>
<h3><strong>Planning</strong></h3>
<p>It is crucial for the contact managers to set goals. At Fusion, we do set goals and try to identify the cycles so that our managers can prepare in advance and deliver before being asked. Be proactive, know the audience and anticipate a response for better results.</p>
<h3><strong>Action</strong></h3>
<p>Do have ‘Plan A’ and ‘Plan B’ both in your hand, if you are going to jump into the action. This ensures effective contact center management. Sometimes action is associated with risk and risk might lead to mistakes. However, inaction is also risky.</p>
<p>When you think to seek something in urgency, do not lose focus. Since, in urgency you will meet only chaos and confusion. Do not react on the stressful situations and keep a strong hold on the clarity and relevance. Do conduct a root analysis on issues to gain a fuller knowledge of the business.</p>
<h3><strong>Partnership</strong></h3>
<p>Customers are everything that a call center has. Not only customers but agents, clients, successors etc all are an essential part of a call center. It is good to balance the things in a right manner and serve the people with the best interest. Everyone might not be happy all the time, but carefully listen to them through <strong>Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)</strong> or <strong>Employee Satisfaction (ESAT)</strong> surveys, exit interviews, focus groups, call recordings etc.</p>
<p>At Fusion, our people the ones who are associated with our contact center actively follow the basic five rules stated above to lessen the stressful operations on the contact center floor.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you mean by customer loyalty? – It is the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/top-3-call-center-practices-that-consumers-prefer.html">desire of the customer</a> to trust, consider and tolerate. This thought of customer loyalty is applicable across all verticals.</p>
<p>Certain industries are able to drive better consumer loyalty across different timeline. Who are these industries? – Contact centers. They are the higher driver of loyalty in different touch points on the macro level in the telecom environment better than a retail chain.</p>
<p>Well, we are not saying that the contact center is not the strong loyalty driver in the retail industry, but over the phone they can build bigger experience. However, the basis for consumer loyalty depends on the in-store experience, and we know that it will bring a broad smile of the face of the customers.</p>
<p>Well, there are issues where we usually do not lose the loyalty towards the company. Like the company to whom we rely may keep us on hold for more than half an hour and resolve the problem for a next half an hour, but still they do not lose the trust of the customer.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are instances where we do not have confidence on our service provider. Cable and internet work well and, we often do not have a problem with them. However, the billing and moving issues may lead to the contact centers, and their customers have a terrible contact center experiences. It drives the loyalty of the customers to a lower margin.</p>
<p>Installing advanced technology, contact centers want to improve their customer loyalty. Thus, the installation of <a class="zem_slink" title="Interactive voice response" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">IVR</a> and Visual IVR took place. Fusion plays a large role in the customer’s perception of the brand and, therefore, the experience needs to be flawless. Fusion thus uses IVR and Visual IVR to accelerate their call center performance.</p>
<p>Efficiency of the IVR comes with the combination of ease and speed. The <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/call-center-outsourcing-become-more-efficient.html">advanced IVR technologies</a> surpass the traditional IVR models. Since, the former gives more opportunity to influence the callers with sophisticated and brand reflecting automation that increase sales and the customer experience.</p>
<p>According to the survey done by the <a href="http://www.pvko.nl/upload/documenten/presentaties/CRM-Association-Gungor.pdf" target="_blank">Platform Voor Klantgericht Ondernemen</a> says, that on an average 20-30% of customers are delightful in keeping up the loyalty with a particular company, yet 10-25% are still disappointing. The survey also says that the negative contact has a stronger effect than the satisfied ones.</p>
<p>With the use of IVR technologies, the performance of the call center has boosted. Take a look at the table below for further details:</p>
<table style="border:solid 2px #4BACC6; width:600px; text-align:center" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center">
<tr>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">

<tr>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">Disappointed Customers</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">45%</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">59%</td>

<tr style="background:#D2EAF1;">
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">Angry Customers</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">19%</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">45%</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Fusion believes in the motto – “<em>Positive the Customer Contacts, Stronger the Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty</em>. “</p>
<p>Fusion makes the automated experience seamless and thus our callers are more willing to buy. This helps to increase our customer trust, and if our customer is frustrated, the automated part of the call won’t increase the frustration level.</p>
<p>Thus, for a positive experience and better consumer loyalty, Fusion gives thumbs up for IVR solutions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can a call center stand out as a leader? Delivering excellent customer experience is one way of achieving the goal. The exceptional experience leads to a greater number of satisfied customers, and creates a loyal customer base that not only continues to purchase the product or service of a company but also recommends others to do the same.</p>
<p>Callers today use channels – phone, web or mobile applications to communicate with the company. Using multiple channels to get customer service is the latest trend in customer service industry and is referred to as multi-channel customer service.</p>
<p>Multi-channel customer service is not just about multiple support options. It is also about delivering the exceptional service through a channel, which the customers find suitable. Although multi-channel supports are in higher demand today, talking to a live agent still remains the most preferred way of customer interaction. However, in order to talk to a live agent, customers using different channels face some issues.</p>
<p>Do you know how long the customers are waiting in the queue before their questions are addressed? The longer they wait the lower drops their tolerance level. This makes them frustrated. So, reducing or eliminating the time of waiting in the queue (also known as hold time) is one important aspect of customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Now how will you eliminate the call holding time? – Here you will find the three highly preferred ways through which you can eliminate the hold time.</p>
<h2>How to Eliminate the Call Holding Time?</h2>
<p>In order to minimize the hold time, most of the contact centers offer better self-service options or attempt to reduce the call handling time. People, it is time to think outside the box. At Fusion, we prefer to do that. Check out the ways that can reduce the hassles of customers using different communication channels.</p>
<h3>1.  For Customers Who Use Phone</h3>
<p>A phone is one of the most preferred channels to resolve issues quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, during peak hours, all customer service executives remain busy on calls. As a result, many customers have to wait to talk to the personnel. This often leads to making customers unhappy. To eliminate the problem, organizations should offer a callback option instead of keeping the callers waiting.</p>
<h3>2.  For Customers Who Use Website</h3>
<p>Do you know what happens when the customers contact you via websites? Most of the sites only list a phone number and an email address – this is not the most convenient method to interact with customers. Why don’t you offer the same callback option through your website? It is the best solution that one can implement and leave a positive impression on the visitors. Fusion has incorporated request a callback option in their website. This has helped them streamline the calls and handle each issue effectively.</p>
<h3>3. For Customers Who Use Mobile</h3>
<p>If you look at a recent survey, you will find that mobile app downloads (total) rose by 171% from 6.1 billion to 16.5 billion between 2010 and 2011. (<a href="http://ovum.com/press_releases/mobile-phone-application-downloads-to-grow-144-this-year/" target="_blank">Resource</a>: Mobile Application Download and Revenue Forecast: 2011–16)</p>
<p>When customers click on the “Contact Us” page within the mobile app, what will they see? – A phone number? The customers do not prefer that. Do not send customers to the <a class="zem_slink" title="Interactive voice response" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">IVR</a>.  Allow them to put in their number and request a callback. If you want put yourself ahead of your competitors, then have a click-to-call option. Remember, your customers are using the technology for a long time.  If you cannot keep up with that, they will go somewhere else.</p>
<p>The Callback is one such approach that allows you to give better service to your clients on their preferred channels. They provide the same caller experience regardless of the fact how they choose to contact you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>“Satisfied customers and loyal customers – both have a big difference between themselves. To succeed in customer expectations, we have to know their expectation in the very beginning.”</i></p>
<p>If you are having a business and would like to use the outsourcing business, what will be your demand? Obviously, an effective customer service that is not only best but also legendary.</p>
<p>The business owners of today expect more online, social and immediate interactions from customers and that too in their native language, via preferred channel. The <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/call-center-outsourcing-become-more-efficient.html">technological innovation</a> has not only made the world easily accessible but also removed the geographical and linguistic boundaries.</p>
<p>The creation of the multicultural events in every organization helps to increase the accessibility. Some businesses are still struggling to meet the customer demands and need enough solutions to stay competitive. In such an environment, how contact centers can help the businesses?</p>
<p>With the advancement in the technology, the businesses rely on the automated innovation to save money, utilize the available resources. This helps to do drive the brand loyalty by giving the customers what they actually want. The deployment of automated translation opens up the lines of communication with the customers in their way.</p>
<h3>Speak Globally!</h3>
<p>Users prefer to interact with companies in the native language – a large section of the customers says that they need to communicate in their native language. To value the customers we at <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/multilingual-call-center.html">Fusion provide multilingual support</a>.</p>
<p>Deployment of the automated translation technology helps to remove the linguistic barriers in your contact center. It helps the Fortune 500 companies to deliver product information via 35 languages. The automated translation system, allows the call center agent to support customers in real time through multiple languages, cost–effectively and retaining the quality of the service.</p>
<h3>Service in Real-Time and Gaining Multilingual Support</h3>
<p>According to the statistics and the survey done by <em>Harris Interactive</em>, 86% of the customers stopped their business transactions just because of poor customer experience.  It is impossible to say, when a customer will come up with a problematic issue. To maintain the customer retention, right support is indeed required for a positive experience.</p>
<p>Offering appropriate language coverage at the time, require the employment of a pool of multilingual agents. However, with an automated translation we are now able to handle dozens of jobs by empowering the agents to interact with customers in any language. With the advanced technology and right tools business can get 24/7 service to support compilation of worldwide customer inquiries.</p>
<h3>Enable the Support Budgets</h3>
<p>In this tight economic schedule, the demand to cover the new market expansion is more crucial and businesses are eager to take advantage of the situation. The automated translation equipments, helps to reduce the need to hire new resources across the boundaries that are retaining the market and further goes beyond and invests in the new markets.</p>
<p>Contact center managers at <em>Fusion</em> focuses on the customer satisfaction and save the revenue on communication obstacles, which their employees face. We further provide our agents with the tools to help customers regardless of their language and address more support scenarios than we used to do before.</p>
<h3>Self-Service Option for Global Customers</h3>
<p>The aim of the automated translation technology is to improve the global customer experience and enable the self-service channel in different languages that too cost-effectively.</p>
<p>As the world has gone social, so the unhappy customers who experience the broken brand may express their dissatisfaction to thousands of friends over the internet.</p>
<p>The multilingual knowledge base contents and the FAQs can deflect the calls and reduces the overhead costs to create great customer experience. This is a win-win situation for the customers and the call center. If the average inquiry to a call center costs $33, the self-service will cost them one or two dollars.</p>
<p>To create dependable, highly successful and renowned brand – is just to cater effective customer support. Contact centers believe that customers are the “Boss” and he or she can fire the chairpersons of the company any time, just by spending their money somewhere else.</p>
<p>To meet consumerism demand contact centers has made a shift in their motto and has planned to speak global. To provide fast hand user experience and positive interaction they use automated translation to fetch better ROI and widen the customer base.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where do you see yourself in 5 years from now? – A common but seemingly unnerving question from the interviewer. How can one correctly predict his future? And yet having a vision, a goal and prudence is essential. The same thing applies for outsourcing business. No one can predict what the future has in store for the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-india-is-taking-business-to-the-next-level.html">global outsourcing industry</a>, but one can surely have an idea –</p>
<p>As per the outsourcing experts, over the period next 5 years &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Offshore vendors will differentiate themselves more depending on service offered and industry verticals served. To be in the market, they need to demonstrate specific skills and knowledge and not just cost arbitrage.</li>
<li>Certain industries like retail, education and travel in continue to lean heavily on outsourcing while others may not significantly increase their offshore functions.</li>
<li>Non-voice contact centers will increasingly be performed offshore and its great will be significantly higher than the low growth experienced in the total voice sector.</li>
<li>Clients of outsourced vendors will have a better idea of what works offshore and what does not. This will reflect in their outsourcing pattern.</li>
<li>Offshore remote &#8211; based agents will not rise significantly. But offshore call centers that focus on cold call sales, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/life-insurance-appointment-setting-service-quality-life-insurance-leads.html">appointment setting</a>, customer support and IT support will keep thriving.</li>
<li>Offshore vendors will be the main beneficiary of non-voice contact center activity including email and chat support, order processing, social media communications, email marketing etc.</li>
<li>India and The Philippines will continue to be the main benefactor of global outsourcing industry.</li>
<li>Low-end outbound activity will continue to be a strong area of growth for offshore</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, as <a href="http://www.call-centres.com/articles/?p=39" target="_blank">Rob O’Malley</a> is right to point out, there is no longer a place for weak offshore vendors in the next 5 years. Only those who are able to differentiate services will remain in business in the long run. Having a track record of offering services specific to different industry verticals, <em>Fusion </em>strongly believes that to be in business, an outsourcing vendor needs to stress more on specialized services, agent training and cost handling.</p>
<p>Fusion is also of the opinion that in another 5 years, <a href="http://www.sociableblog.com/2013/01/28/how-to-choose-the-right-cloud-for-your-business/" target="_blank">cloud-based systems</a> will dominate the call center industry. Everything from customer data to telephony software will be available on cloud, giving call centers greater flexibility and savings. Since Fusion has contact centers in US, Canada, India and the Philippines, It will also be easy for them to manage the operations through cloud.</p>
<p>In other words, 5 years from now, intelligent call centers that can adapt to ever-changing technology, customized requirements of their clients and their customers (who will be reaching the call centers through various channels including telephone, chat, email, social network etc.), will continue to operate. This vision has lead Fusion to adapt some important changes in their operational strategies. It plans to give special attention on the following areas.</p>
<h3>Intelligent call routing</h3>
<p>As a matter of fact, social media and web 2.0 channels have over 50% penetration in different contact center operations while around 25% smartphone users use internet on phone, the role of a contact center is changing rapidly. And to adapt to such changes, every contact center needs a <a href="http://unified-communications.tmcnet.com/topics/unified-communications/articles/322922-uc-expansion-feeds-off-byod-growth.htm" target="_blank">BYOD</a> intelligent call routing based on the following –</p>
<ul>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Type of request</li>
<li>Communication channels or device</li>
</ul>
<p>This will essentially reduce the call transfer by 1-2 minutes per call and thus will help offer better service.</p>
<h3>Role of Agents</h3>
<p>Owing to various needs of the customers, the role of agents will also change. They need to be</p>
<ul>
<li>Product or service specialist</li>
<li>Multilingual</li>
<li>Expert in social engagement and response</li>
<li>Expert in Conflict resolution and crisis resolution</li>
<li>Specialist in cross selling and up selling</li>
</ul>
<p>Training agents to handle all kind of issues and on specialized services can help clients to get better service for their customers. Having <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/multilingual-call-center.html">multilingual</a> and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/french-call-center.html">French-speaking agents</a> on board, Fusion will get the maximum benefit of an intelligent routing system.</p>
<h3>Broadening Of Social Media, Web and Email Support</h3>
<p>With customers using different communication channels, the contact centers too needs to <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/social-customer-services-personalize-customer-support.html">broaden its social media and web support</a> approach. As non-voice operations are going to have a bigger share of contact center operations, Fusion is stressing on the non-voice services as well.</p>
<h3>Specialization to Cater to Different Industry Verticals</h3>
<p>Fusion has a long experience in offering customize services specific to different industry verticals. Travel (including <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/travel_tourism.html">Timeshare</a>), education, financial services and retail are some of the verticals that the company caters to.</p>
<p>Apart from these, Fusion also recommends maintaining a customer-centric approach in the work culture. To achieve this, one needs to-</p>
<ul>
<li>Adapt new technologies</li>
<li>Create a proper data management ecosystem and use right person at the right place on right time.</li>
<li>Empower agents to offer unique user experience</li>
<li>Use new channels to offer a great customer service.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a contact center can adapt these changes, they can emerge as the next-gen contact center that is here to stay.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Employees are the structural unit of a company and to get the maximum output from them, a company must take care of their happiness and well-being.</p>
<p><i>Do you think that the positive emotions influence the performance of your employees?</i></p>
<p><i>Are you optimistic to generate better results? </i></p>
<p>According to the research done by the positive psychology team, both the answers are “Yes”. The happiness of your employees is sure to influence their performance.</p>
<p><a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/martin-seligman-father-positive-psychology-3376382.html" target="_blank">Martin Seligman</a> and his team developed a branch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology" target="_blank">positive psychology</a> that studies the effect of the positive emotions and the development of the virtue of the people. The areas they include are &#8211; <i>happiness, creativity, optimism, humor, resilience and emotional intelligence.</i></p>
<p>We, at Fusion believe that the management of the contact center can be enriched by the use of this particular theory. The Positive Psychology team is of the opinion that when the job makes sense to the employees, it generates satisfaction and fulfillment. This is in contrast to the traditional working formula that linked to sacrifice by the employees. In contrary to this belief, studies also proved that positive psychology could be a great source of energy and comprehensiveness to maintain the continuity of “flow”.</p>
<p>Are you aware of the concept of “flow”? &#8211;  The concept of “flow “ was developed by the psychologist <a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi.html" target="_blank">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a>, who explained the state in which the person gets completely absorbed in a kind of activity for his or her own pleasure and enjoyment during time files and the action, thought, movements and succeeds without any pause.</p>
<p>He also argues that the person who is in “flow” is completely absorbed by the activity, during which they loses the track of time and experiences a great satisfaction indeed. Actually, the concept goes like this – if we enjoy the work we do, we experience this kind of feeling.</p>
<p align="center"><iframe src="http://embed.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<h3>How Contact Centers Apply This Concept In The Management?</h3>
<p>Many contact centers, even Fusion apply this concept to enhance their employee performance rate. Contact center can apply this concept through three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicating Clear Objectives</li>
<li>Immediate Feedbacks</li>
<li>Balancing the Individual Challenges to Skills</li>
</ul>
<h3>Communicating Clear Objectives</h3>
<p>The employees will perform well enough, if they are aware of the expectation that their boss and company have from him or her. The key factor stresses on the personalized communication, which is similar to the style of each contributor.</p>
<h3>Immediate Feedbacks</h3>
<p>Keep time in your hand to give good feedback to your team. The invocation is able to promote learning and encourages the positive agents. Providing feedback does not mean that you will pointing out the errors, rather you need to emphasize on what went right and what was not considered as an opportunity to learn something.</p>
<h3>Balancing the Individual Challenges to Skills</h3>
<p>When the objectives are stored at a long distance and if you think of implementing them, then be sure to meet with conflicts. Employees’ experiences frustration at every level, and feels discontent like their supervisors. Many times this frustration is caused due to the negative feedback. Therefore, the contact center management needs to maintain a balance between collaborative and operational needs. Dialogue and the feedbacks are the two meters to report on the balance sought.</p>
<p>Therefore, look for the three options to implement in your contact center management and boost up your employee happiness meter.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good News for the call center owners in India!!</p>
<p>The leading outsourcing researchers and the business analysts have predicted that 2013 is going to be profitable to the Indian call center industry. The 100 billion IT industries are going to round up this year with some positive outlook.</p>
<p>More business is showing their interest to invest in technology. With the recent economic developments year 2013 is going to rock!</p>
<p>If we compare the economy of 2013 with 2012, we will witness that it has been improving at a faster pace – especially in the US, China and India. Outsourcing experts are of the opinion that the industry is going to contribute more towards the global economy in 2013.</p>
<p>The contact center experts at Fusion are of the opinion that nominal IT budget and the macro environment will continue to threat the Indian IT-BPO industry. As technology is becoming an integral part of the corporate industry, 2013 is surely going to be magical for the Indian IT industry.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Looking Back At the Year 2012</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In the year 2012, Indian IT industry had to deal with the factors like hikes in the costs, poor value of the Indian currency, high production prices and the geopolitical instances. On account of all these, <a href="http://www.nasscom.in" target="_blank">NASSCOM</a> (<em>National Association of Software and Services Companies</em>) lowered the growth of the <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/info-tech/nasscom-confident-of-double-digit-growth-for-industry-next-fiscal/article2630522.ece" target="_blank">forecast for 2012-2013</a> (IT and BPO exports) to 11%-14%, from the earlier fiscal target of 16%-18%.</p>

Chandrasekaran (left), Chairman, with Som Mittal, President, Nasscom, addressing a press conference in Mumbai on Monday. Photo: Paul Noronha (The Hindu)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 2013, the Indian IT industry is all charged up to embrace the new technologies like – <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/what-cloud-computing-really-means-031" target="_blank">cloud computing</a>, analytics to maximize the goal in the particular business environment that too within the cheaper budget and to activate the social media platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Looking Forward In the Year 2013</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Why do you think business likes to outsource to the IT industries in India?</p>
<p>India is the second largest exporter of IT and software services and they continue to remain as the source of technical and management talent for the 40% new startups in the United States. Most of the contact centers in India are certified <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso_9000.htm" target="_blank">ISO 9000</a> label than any other country in the world. India is able to leverage the outbound and inbound services at an affordable cost.</p>
<p>Around half of the world’s Fortune 500 companies, all prefer to use the India IT-BPO services.</p>
<p>If they continue to maintain their relationship with the companies across the seas at the same level, then surely India is going to turn themselves into the IT giants of the New Millennium. Over 4 million trained professionals and along with a better infrastructure and government support, India is surely going to take your business to the next level.</p>
<p>The US companies have rated that India is the number one choice for business outsourcing. With the services provided by inbound and outbound call center, India is able to give business a competitive edge in 2013.</p>
<p>Whatever you might think to outsource – application development, system software development, mobile application development, IT services all can be systematically handled by the Indian outsourcing companies.</p>
<p>The Gartner Research Institute has <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2174215" target="_blank">further affirmed</a> that IT –BPO industry in Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan) will grow up to $9.5 billion in 2016 compared to $5.9 billion in 2011. So, it is expected that India will contribute to a fair share on that growth.</p>
<p>Due to the rapid shift in the industry from business process outsourcing to business process management, will serve all the verticals. The Economic Survey report of 2012-2013 says that India has to face a tough competition globally, but the high demand for outsourcing is going to help them contribute in the major share to the Indian economy.</p>
