								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Kerala_floods">recent flood</a> in Kerala, India, Fusion BPO has extended a helping hand to the people affected in that devastating flood. As part of its CSR initiatives, Fusion has donated monetary aid, clothing and care packages to Goonj, a renowned NGO working relentlessly to improve the living condition of the millions affected by the flood of August, 2018.</p>
<p>Fusion BPO has always participated in various <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/csr-india.html">CSR activities</a> by teaming up with a local NGO. It has a longstanding commitment towards the betterment of society. Since its inception, the company has been serving the community by taking part in several programs that aid the community and improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>In the recent Kerala flood, over one million people have lost everything they had and are still in relief camps. In such a situation they are in dire need for clothing, food and care packages. All Fusion employees have come forward to contribute for the cause and have donated both money and clothing items to aid the victims of Kerala flood.</p>
<p>At Fusion we will continue to fulfill our social responsibilities and serve our community, especially those in need of help to make their lives better.</p>
