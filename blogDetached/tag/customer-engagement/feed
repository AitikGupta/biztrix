<p>Chatbots have been on the rise since a couple of years and
have already gained popularity. Chatbots can help businesses interact with
their customers and prospects in a new way using messaging apps, the latest
technology, and Artificial Intelligence. </p>



<h2>What is a Chatbot?</h2>



<p>A chatbot is a service that can interact with you just like a real person. Powered by rules and  Artificial Intelligence, chatbots are programmed to simulate a real conversation with users through a chat interface. They are based on machine learning to imitate human conversation and react to service requests.</p>



<p>AI helps them learn the language, human tone, and behavior with every interaction, which in turn helps them to be more intelligent and serve the users better. </p>



<p>For a better understanding of how chatbots can contribute to
your business, let us find the top 7 benefits of chatbots:</p>



<h2>1. Being Present on Messaging Platforms</h2>



<p>Today messaging applications have more users than social
media network. And as customers today think that chat is a convenient and
faster way to interact with a business, businesses today have the chance to
reach more audience via chatbots while staying trendy.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The Majority of smartphone users today do not want to
download new apps. So, businesses can integrate their chatbot in one of the
popular platforms that the customers use on a daily basis such as &#8211; Facebook,
Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. It will also save you time and money. </p>



<h2>2. Improved Customer Service</h2>



<h4>A. Extensive Customer Assistance</h4>



<p>According to a <a href="https://econsultancy.com/83-of-online-shoppers-need-support-to-complete-a-purchase-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">survey</a>, 83% of online shoppers want assistance during shopping. So, your customers may need assistance at any time. Additionally, shoppers may also face navigation issues, or have queries about registration, payment, checkout, and delivery or about the product itself.</p>



<p>In such situations, chatbots can provide real-time assistance through interactive communication over text and voice. They can also provide customers with important relevant information from knowledge base, blogs, tutorial videos and so on.</p>



<h4>B. Always-Available Customer Support</h4>



<p>A great 24/7 customer service has a positive impact on customer satisfaction. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">Chatbots can help you improve the customer support</a> process by quickly giving automated answers to repetitive questions immediately and forwarding the complex ones to a human agent.</p>



<p>Apart from that, chatbots allow businesses to attend more queries at the same time, allowing companies to scale up their operation to new markets globally.</p>



<h4>C. Proactive Customer Interaction</h4>



<p>Companies can also use chatbots to start <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/proactive-customer-service-and-how-to-start-practicing-it.html">proactive customer interactions</a> regarding any issue, any time of the day.

<h2>3. Increased Customer Engagement</h2>

Chatbots can provide the customers with a specific slice of information and
lead the interaction based on the user input at that time.&nbsp; This way, chatbots never provides a dull
interaction with irrelevant and useless information resulting in better
engagement. </p>



<h2>4. Monitoring Consumer Data and Gaining Insights</h2>



<p>Businesses can make changes in their service/products based on the feedback chatbots collect through simple questions. As chatbots are also capable of tracking purchasing patterns and consumer behavior by monitoring user data, they can also help a company to decide marketing strategies.</p>



<p>Companies can use chatbots to track consumer request and responses, predict responses based on the language and direct the chatbot to suggest an alternative product or service. </p>



<h2>5. Cost Savings</h2>
