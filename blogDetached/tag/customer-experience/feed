<p>Customer experience is the need of the hour. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-quick-tips-can-improve-your-customer-experience-instantly.html">Great customer experience can make your customers happy</a> and happy customers result in more business.  That is why more and more businesses these days are trying to provide their customers with state-of-the-art customer service. </p>



<p>Today when the customers expect nothing but the best
treatment from the company, the standard customer service cannot offer the same
level of satisfaction. For that, you need to shift from reactive to proactive
customer service.&nbsp; </p>



<h2>What is Reactive and Proactive Customer Service?</h2>



<p>Reactive customer service is when a customer has a question
while browsing your website, contacts you via different communication channels
and waits for a response. This is the standard customer service that most companies
provide. </p>



<p>Proactive customer service means anticipating customer
issues and addressing them proactively through a number of communication
channels (including forums, FAQs, knowledge base, and instructional videos).
Reaching out to your customers to inform them about a problem before they have
experienced it is an example of proactive customer service. Proactive customer
service has the power to get your customers live for your brand.</p>



<h2>Why is Proactive Support Important?</h2>



<p>Proactive customer support offers a number of benefits for
your business. These are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increase
customer loyalty</strong> – According to a report by <a href="https://medium.com/@Workato/what-role-will-ai-play-in-the-future-of-customer-service-7332a7e503b7">Enkata</a>
taking initiative in your support can boost customer retention rates by 3-5%.</li><li><strong>Decrease
support calls</strong> – Being proactive can help your business identify issues and
resolve them before they turn into problems, and thus can reduce the number of
tickets you receive.</li><li><strong>Take
charge of communication</strong> – By being proactive you can get involved in what
your customers are saying about your brand in private and on social media.&nbsp; You will also get a chance to engage with
them in a way that puts your business in a favorable light.</li><li><strong>Acquire
new customers</strong> &#8211; By being proactive you will get the opportunities to reach
out to prospective customers, and encourage them to switch to your brand.</li><li><strong>Retain
existing customers</strong> &#8211; When you proactively reach out to your customers, even
when they haven’t mentioned you directly, it deepens the relationship. With
social media customer service on the rage, you will need to go that extra mile
to exceed their expectations of good customer service. </li><li><strong>Create brand
advocates</strong> &#8211; Proactive customer service offers the chance to turn your
customers into brand advocates. &nbsp;Studies
show that a happy customer will tell at least 3 people about their experience.</li><li><strong>Protection
against escalation</strong> &#8211; You can avoid a social crisis by early identification
negativity surrounding your brand. </li></ul>



<p>This shows that proactive is the way to go for customer service.  While reactive customer service will cover your base, proactive customer service will take customer satisfaction and loyalty to a whole new level. According to a study by inContact, consumers were generally positive with proactive service. In fact, 87% of adults surveyed are happy to be contacted proactively by different companies regarding customer service issues. </p>



<h2>So How to Introduce Proactive Customer Service in Your Business? </h2>



<p>Here are a few easy tips:</p>



<h4>1. Ask for Feedback</h4>



<p>Customer service is about giving customers what they want. So, the first thing you have to do is to find out what they want. And the best way to do so is by asking them. If you check on your customers regularly, you may identify your weakness and correct them before your customers start to resent it. </p>



<h4>2. Announce Your Mistakes Before Customers Find Out</h4>



<p>Have you identified a problem in your product, service or
operations? It is better than your customers hear about it directly from you
instead of finding out themselves. Admitting your mistake, apologizing, fixing
the issue quickly, and/or offering a discount to compensate for their
inconvenience can help you earn your customer’s trust, avoid bad PR, and ensure
that the customers do not go anywhere.&nbsp; </p>



<h4>3. Reward Customer Loyalty </h4>



<p>Offering rewards for regular business is a good
loyalty-building tool. Loyalty programs demonstrate your company’s desire to
reward a customer as a token of thanks. You can proactively reach out to
customers with offers in between purchases. This can be a chance for positive
interaction with customers that strengthens their relationship with your
company. For example – you can send a discount voucher to your customers a
month before their subscription with you ends, compelling them to renew the
subscription. </p>



<h4>3. Pay Attention to What Your Customers Are Saying Online</h4>



<p>Pay close attention to what your customers are saying about
your brand online. If you reach out to customers who mentioned your brand in
their post, whether in a good context or bad, you will be able to address their
needs preemptively and increase their customer satisfaction.</p>



<h4>4. Create A Knowledge Base for Common Questions</h4>



<p>If you look carefully, you will find a set of common
questions that your customers frequently ask your customer support team or
search online. If you create a knowledge base where the answers to these
questions are provided, it will help your customers easily get their answers
without calling your customer service department. It will save time and bring
down the number of support calls. </p>



<h4>5. Introduce Live Chat</h4>



<p>Having a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="live chat (opens in a new tab)">live chat</a> on your website helps your customers resolve their queries while browsing your site. According to some, the ability to get answers from a live chat representative during an online purchase is among the most important features a business can offer. Proactively asking your customers if they need help through live chat can result in more business.</p>



<p>These are a few tips that can help your business adopt proactive customer service practices.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With customers today exposed the gold standard of customer service, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-quick-tips-can-improve-your-customer-experience-instantly.html">great customer experience</a> has become the need of the hour for businesses. You need to deliver nothing short of 5-star customer experience through every channel every single time.  </p>



<p><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">Live chat</a> has come across as an excellent customer interaction channel through which it is possible to deliver great customer experience. Want to know how? Here are nine easy steps to achieve excellence in customer experience:</p>



<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Make the Chat button visible</h3>



<p>Make sure that your customers can find that chat or contact
button easily on your website. If the customer has to look for it, it does not
amount to great customer experience. Setting up an automated and customized
message that engage your audience is a great way to get noticed. A prominent
and colorful chat now button will do the trick too.</p>



<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Don’t let the customer wait</h3>



<p>Once the chat starts do not let your customers wait for an
answer. The point of having a chat is not having to wait in a queue. Have your
live chat agents talk to a few visitors at a time. This way you will always
have somebody ready to chat.</p>



<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Personalize</h3>



<p>Personalizing results in great experience. You can use live
chat software that integrates with CRM to gather information about the customer
including their location, chat history, etc. The information will give you an
insight into the customer. You can also find important insight about the
customer from the notes made by you and your colleagues.</p>



<h3>Step 4 &#8211; Lend an Ear</h3>



<p>While chatting with a customer, live chat agents should be
more precise when providing solutions, as they have customers’ questions and
needs written in front of them. Listening to their problems first will help you
find a precise solution a lot quicker.</p>



<h3>Step 5 &#8211; Let the customer know if you need more time</h3>



<p>There will be times when a ready solution is not available.
So when you feel the need for some research or expert advice, communicate the
same to your customer. Give them a time frame and get back to the customer
within the timeframe. </p>



<h3>Step 6 &#8211; Take it easy on canned responses</h3>



<p>Use simple and clear language while talking with customers.
Having a personality while interacting via live chat will help you provide a
great experience to your customers. It is better to not use too many canned
responses. Use them only when you need to speed up the interaction while not
compromising with customer satisfaction.</p>



<h3>Step 7 &#8211; Empathy is everything</h3>



<p>Empathy is a must-have skill for everyone who wants to work
in customer support. Without the ability to imagine what the customers go
through and how does it make them feel, your reactions won’t be genuine.&nbsp; Knowing the situation, the customer is in
will help you find the solution fast.</p>



<h3>Step 8 &#8211; End a chat on a positive note</h3>



<p>You have probably heard the phrase – “<em>All’s well that ends well</em>”. It is true for your live chat interactions as well. The way you finish your interaction will have a lasting impression. If handled poorly, it can create a bitter memory for the customer. Ask customers if they’re satisfied with the solution you provided or whether there’s any part of the conversation that they didn’t understand and need further explanation.</p>



<p>Also, you need to ask if there’s anything else that they
need help with. You can end the chat with an intention to hear from them.
Saying this will remind them that you are there for them<strong>.</strong></p>



<h3>Step 9 &#8211; Follow up with a customer</h3>



<p>Do not forget to send a follow up to a customer -it is the best way to finish an amazing customer service. You can use email for the follow-up and ask if everything is working the way they should.</p>



<p>This way you can provide your customers with a great customer experience via live chat. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While voice remains the number one channel for interaction
between business and its customers, the new age customers today are more
inclined to solve the basic customer service issues by themselves.&nbsp; And for that reason, businesses today are
adding self-service to their customer service channels. Self-service can not
only help customers to save time but also can help businesses boost customer
experience and drive customer loyalty. </p>



<p>These are five types of customer self-service a business can
introduce to boost your customer experience.</p>



<h3>1. Customer Self-service Portals</h3>



<p>If you have customers around the clock, you must have a team
of customer service representatives who can give support 24/7 support around
the world. If you do not have such facility and operate limited hours, a large
section of your customers will have a hard time reaching you. Also, the younger
tech-savvy crowd will definitely look for their answers online even before
reaching your customer service.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Rather than leaving your customer without support from your end, you can invest in a customer self-service portal that contains answers to the most common queries, instruction for basic fixes and a few others that a customer can easily resolve.</p>



<p>Using this portal, a customer can get answers to their basic queries and explore the knowledge base for further details during the non-operational hours. This also allows them to bypass the calling queue and get their answer from your end at their own time and pace. </p>



<p>An additional perk?&nbsp;
The self-service portal can significantly decrease your customer service
costs!</p>



<h3>2. Mobile</h3>



<p>Today most people browse the internet from their smartphone.
Scratch that, people today do almost everything on their smartphone – it’s
easy, it’s convenient and a powerful tool that fits in your pocket.</p>



<p>A mobile app or mobile version of your site can prove to be
beneficial as a self-service tool. However, make sure to make the mobile
version of site user-friendly so that your customers can easily navigate
through the site to find the answers they are looking for.</p>



<p>You can also build a user-friendly app that offers push
notifications and updated features that help you keep the customers updated
about the company and its service updates.</p>



<h3>3. Chatbots and AI</h3>



<p>Live chatbots can offer a great customer experience. With
the help of AI, chatbots can answer customer queries in a matter of seconds.
chatbots can help customers by answering their queries, assisting them, and
even helping them with booking and sales. With live chatbots, finding answers to
your queries have become easier than ever. </p>



<p>Live chatbots are a great way to help confused customers.
Many company sites offer a popup chat window that appears after a certain
period of time spent on the website. These bots have the capability to guide
the customer to the answers they are looking for. Even when they do not have
answers, they can point the customers in the right direction. These chatbots
are also a great way to show that your company cares for its customers and CX.</p>



<h3>4. Kiosks</h3>



<p>A kiosk can be good for short, specific tasks, such as
finding an item in a physical store or checking the price. Self-checkout kiosks
can also help a customer with checkout and payment.</p>



<h3>5. Functional Automated Phone Systems</h3>



<p>While the phone remains the preferred business interaction
channel for a large section of customers, the younger generation sees it as the
last resort. You can find a middle ground and offer them the option to speak to
a representative or resolve the issue following an automated menu system and accomplish
the task quickly without needing an agent. </p>



<p>These five types of self-service can help your customers to
quickly find the answer to their queries without needing an agent and boost
their customer experience as well.</p>

Let us look at the data: According to Forrester&#8217;s 2016 U.S. Customer Experience (CX) Index Report, consumers said that only 1 percent of U.S. businesses deliver excellent customer service.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Businesses talk about quality customer experience. But are they really practicing what they preach? Let us look at the data:</p>



<p>According to Forrester&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/The+US+Customer+Experience+Index+2016/-/E-RES131003">2016 U.S. Customer Experience (CX) Index Report</a>, <em>consumers said that only 1 percent of U.S. businesses deliver excellent customer service</em>. The same research found that the state of customer experience stayed stagnant among Canadian businesses, and none of the U.K. companies received a top-rated score.</p>



<p>Clearly, with everyone talking about customer experience,
such a scenario was not expected. It clearly shows that most businesses are
either clueless about customer experience or are too lazy to go that extra mile
to give their customers a state-of-the-art experience. </p>



<p>Either way, it seems that the businesses have a lot to learn to improve customer experience. It will take many big and small changes to reach that place where they can <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/engage-your-agents-xfactor-quality-customer-experience.html">deliver top-class customer experience</a>. Here are a few quick-fixes that can help businesses improve their customer service in an instance.</p>



<h3>1. Say thank you to a power user</h3>



<p>Strengthening your relationship with your power users
sometimes means going offline. Take the time to understand how your product
fits into your customer’s life, recognizing them and appreciating their
business in a uniquely meaningful way will make them feel special.</p>



<h3>2. Personalize </h3>



<p>It has been a trend for many pizza shops to draw a picture
on the pizza box on personal request. Other businesses can take a lesson from
them and start entertaining personal requests on their packaging. While it
takes an extra minute or two, such personalization sends a clear message to
customers that they are seen and heard and that their decision to give you
their business is appreciated by you. </p>



<p>For example – you can ask for your customer’s choice about
how he wants to be addressed the first time he calls and use the same address
every single time. This is particularly important during the trial period.
Taking the time to connect with your customer on a personal level builds a bond
between the customer and the brand that the customer will remember when the
trial is over.</p>



<h3>3. Give away free stuff</h3>



<p>One of the surest ways to make customers happy is to give
them free stuff. But there is a difference between giving away useless stuff
and providing customers with added bonuses that add value to their life or to
their business. And do not forget to personalize the stuff. You see, not
everyone will find the same thing interesting.</p>



<p>Therefore, you should use a web personalization strategy to
help you determine the type of free offering you should offer to different
customer segments.</p>



<h3>4. Fix problems before they occur</h3>



<p>One way of creating outstanding customer experiences and
making customers happy is to solve your customer’s problems before they realize
they exist.</p>



<p>The idea is to stay one step ahead of the customer. It will
give you chance to solve problems proactively and create a flawless customer
experience. It also offers you ample scope of planning your customer outreach
and personalizing it.</p>



<h3>5. Fix your ineffective signup form</h3>



<p>Sign up forms are often among the first things you see when
visiting a product page for the first time. A lengthy form can send potential
customers back before you get the chance to explain what your product does.</p>



<p>Take time to re-evaluate your forms with the help of new and
existing users. Ideally, you should include their feedback to create a more
professional, comfortable experience. 

You can incorporate a few of these tips in your
customer experience to improve its quality instantly.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While we read a lot about how to provide <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/provide-quality-customer-service-to-the-millennials.html">quality
customer experience to the millennials</a> through business interactions,
little has been said about improving customer experience of the elderly. When
you have an elderly customer at the other end of the line, you should treat
them very differently from the way you deal with your millennial customers. </p>



<p>Dealing with an elderly customer comes with its own unique
challenges. You cannot deal with them the way you can deal with millennials and
middle-aged.&nbsp; The reasons behind this
are-</p>



<ul><li>Most of them are not that tech-savvy</li><li>Health deterioration has led to hearing loss and
memory loss among the elderly</li><li>They have a hard time remembering things and
therefore keeps repeating themselves.</li><li>They communicate slower</li><li>They do not like being patronized</li></ul>



<p>Elderly people often find it hard to understand the basics
of modern technology like fixing the simplest computer issue or resolving a
billing problem. Therefore, a customer service agent needs to give extra
attention while attending their calls.</p>



<p>Here are some suggestions for making the interaction go smoothly.</p>



<h3>1. Treat Them with Respect</h3>



<p>Seniors often feel like they are being patronized or belittled by young agents even when it is not so.&nbsp; Therefore, an agent needs to be extra cautious about while talking to them. Instead of talking down to elderly customers, the agent must recognize their wisdom and treat them with respect.</p>



<p>If it’s taking longer to reach a solution due to their slower communication, an agent must not let frustration show. Working with them in a non-condescending tone often achieves much better results.</p>



<h3>2. Write It Down</h3>



<p>Deafness and forgetfulness are often the most common
elements that comes with age and they make getting the message across a
challenge.&nbsp; Therefore, writing down the
information on a notepad or email can make the whole process a lot easier and
help them in a better way.</p>



<h3>3. Give Coupons</h3>



<p>Recognizing the economic standing of the senior customers is
the first step of forging a lasting relationship with your senior customers. Living
off their retirement funds, seniors can benefit from special discounts and
coupons. If you can provide them with special discounts whenever possible, it
will create a good relationship between you and your elderly customers who will
get a strong sense of customer experience. </p>



<h3>4. Patience is Virtue</h3>



<p>Seniors often take longer to make a decision, understand a
request, and respond. But that is no excuse for agents to show their annoyance
or frustration. On the contrary, patience is the key here. Agents need to
slowdown, listen, and gather all information. And once they do that, dealing
with senior customers gets a lot easier.</p>



<h3>5. Maintain a Cheerful and Helpful Attitude</h3>



<p>While the millennials prefer self-help tools, senior
customers are still mostly old-school – they prefer talking to a live agent,
either face-to-face or over the phone. Therefore, agents taking the calls
should maintain a cheerful and helpful attitude to give the senior customers a
good customer service experience.</p>



<h3>6. Lend an Ear</h3>



<p>Many of the elderly customers are lonely and do not even have someone to talk to.&nbsp; Therefore, they ted to talk more even while discussing business with a live human agent. Sharing stories or talking excessively makes them feel better and listening to them goes a long way to create a pleasant experience for them. So, do not cut them off while they are sharing their stories. It will help you resolve the problem and provide them with outstanding customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>While it is not guaranteed that all the elderly customers will have a great customer experience even when you follow the tips mentioned above, but these tips will definitely help you improve their experience and earn their loyalty.  </p>

<p>Even when people know what they are looking for while
shopping, they still may need some assistance for locating them in a
store.&nbsp; And it is not only brick and
mortar store we are talking about, people need ready assistance while online
shopping as well. </p>



<p>According to a study conducted by <a href="http://www.roosit.nl/files/en/documents/Forrester_making_proactive_chat_work.pdf">Forrester Research</a>, 44% of online consumers say that having questions answered by a live person while in the middle of an online purchase is one of the most important features a website can offer.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chat_work.png" alt="Customer Experience Online Survey" class="wp-image-6416" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chat_work.png 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chat_work-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption><em> Live Help Is One Of The Most Important Features A Site Can Offer To US Online Consumers</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>While waiting on a call queue is something customers are not
fond of, communicating with your customer support team via Live chat is
something customers find convenient. It offers your customers a solution to
resolve their queries at the right time without having to leave the page they
are currently viewing.</p>



<p>An advance live chat facility can help you boost your customer experience and drive more sales. The process can also be outsourced easily without hampering the quality of customer experience. A <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/live-chat-support-benefits-every-business.html">quality live chat support</a> must have the following features.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Screen
sharing:</strong> With screen sharing the agent gets temporary access to a
customer’s computer screen and he can navigate on behalf of the customer. It is
easier and simpler way to assist the customer in situations where the customer
is not tech-savvy.</li><li><strong>Co-browsing:</strong>
When the customer is having difficulty placing an order online, the agents can
show how to use the ordering pages with the help of Co-browsing.</li><li><strong>Instant
Messaging:</strong> Instant messaging will help a customer get prompt answer to
their queries, speeding the purchasing process.</li><li><strong>Video
Conferencing:</strong> video conferencing can help you serve a priority customer
better. It calls for better customer experience and more personalized support.</li><li><strong>Calling
Facilities:</strong> Having a calling facility in the live chat support can provide
your customer an opportunity to talk to a live agent making the experience
better.</li></ul>



<p>However, rich features alone cannot create a great chat
support experience for the customers.&nbsp;
For that you need to follow a few live chat best practices.&nbsp; Want to know about them? Check them out:</p>



<h3>1. Make the Most out
of Canned Messages</h3>



<p>By using canned messages, customer service agents can greet
customers fast without having to type it all.</p>



<h3>2. Collect
Information</h3>



<p>Use pre-chat surveys to know the issues your customers have
before they begin typing. Set a routing rule based on this information so that
the chat goes to the right department or agent.</p>



<h3>3. Practice Using
Shortcuts</h3>



<p>Setting shortcut keys for frequently used operations, like
canned responses will help your agents save time. Fusion has successfully used
canned response for its live chat support services and significantly reduced
the Average Handling Time (AHT). </p>



<h3>4. Use Alternate
Media</h3>



<p>You can also save time by sending images, files,
screenshots, or even how-to videos to customers instead of writing complex
responses.</p>



<h3>5. Be clear about Wait Time and Operation Hours</h3>



<p>If an issue cannot be resolved immediately, tell the
customer that and give them a clear wait time and stick to it. Also, if the
live chat support is available 24/7 say so, if not then mention that too. Your
website, social media profile should also have the operational hours mentioned
clearly.</p>



<h3>6. Personalize Your Chat</h3>



<p>Personalize your greeting and responses using the customer’s
name and buyer history. It is a great way to let your customers know that you
care about their unique issue. </p>



<h3>7. Build a Connection</h3>



<p>Use customer service representative names and photos to
build a rapport between your customer and the customer service representatives
at the beginning of the interaction.</p>



<h3>8. Acknowledge and
Empathize</h3>



<p>Being sensitive to your customers’ needs, acknowledging
their concerns makes the customers feel that your care for them and are not
trying to wrap it up quickly.</p>



<h3>9. Use the Right Tone
and Voice </h3>



<p>Your online live chat presence should reflect your brand
identity. Therefore, your chat must have a distinct tone or voice. For example
– a high-end fashion brand will have a different tone than a company selling
soccer merchandise. &nbsp;</p>



<h3>10. Be Positive</h3>



<p>Being positive and friendly in live chat can help you win
your customers over. 

These are the ten best practices for live chart
support your business must follow. In case you do not have the manpower and
budget to offer live chat support round the clock, you can hire a BPO that
offers live chat support as a service.

<p>You have all heard about <em>Powerpuff Girls</em> and how they are made of sugar &amp; spice and all things nice and an accidental dose of chemical X. Without that chemical X or X factor, they would become powerless.  The same thing applies for excellent customer service.  No matter how you incorporate the latest technology, metrics, and communication channels to provide the best customer service through your contact center, it will be quite useless without the factor X – your agents. </p>



<p>The agents are often the unsung heroes of customer service.
They work as the first point of contact for your customers and therefore has
the power to build or ruin a customer experience. According to a study,
companies with engaged employees outperform those without by up to <a href="https://www.business2community.com/business-innovation/remote-workforce-nps-important-metric-youre-missing-01785305#oWRIA4bsxOwz6011.97">202%</a>.
Want to deliver excellent customer experience every single time?&nbsp; Turn your attention to engaging your agents. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/employee-engagement-statistics.jpg" alt="Employee Engagement Statistics" class="wp-image-6395" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/employee-engagement-statistics.jpg 468w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/employee-engagement-statistics-300x238.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></figure></div>



<p>At Fusion, we take agent engagement very seriously and
perform various activities to keep our agents engaged, encouraged and
empowered. Here are a few agent engagement tips that Fusion regularly uses to
keep the agents engaged:</p>



<h3>1. A Sincere thanks </h3>



<p>A little thank you can go a long way. After a successful
campaign or an exhaustive week, a thank you can pick the agents up like nothing
else. We recommend that every manager must have it in their arsenal and use it
regularly.</p>



<h3>2. Training</h3>



<p>The training and orientation program at the beginning of an
agent’s tenure in your organization is often exhaustive.&nbsp; There’s a lot to take in within a short
period. Therefore, some agents tend not to remember each and everything taught
at the initial training.&nbsp; To fix this,
Fusion arranges custom training for them that help them catch up and improve
their performance. </p>



<p>Fusion also arranges cross-trainings with a goal of
increasing employee knowledge. We have them trained in other departments or
positions, help them learn new skills and languages.&nbsp; It provides a sense of value to an employee
and puts them on a fast track for improvement.</p>



<h3>3. Offsite events </h3>



<p>Everyone needs to break their mundane cycle and let their
hair down every once in a while. And that is exactly what your agents need.
Take the team out of the office and have some fun. Take them on a picnic, a
happy hour, an after-office badminton session, or a football tournament. Allow
them to have fun and enjoy each other’s company. Your team deserves this. </p>



<h3>4. Communicate
expectations and reward the efforts</h3>



<p>As the old saying goes – “<em>Tell me and I forget; show me and I remember; involve me and I understand</em>” you need to involve your agents and show them the big picture.  This way, the agents will know what is expected from them and how they can drive the company towards success. And when they meet that expectation, do not forget to recognize their efforts, encourage them, and reward them. This means the world to them. </p>



<h3>5. Reward and
recognitions</h3>



<p>Provide incentives and praise. It really shows agents how
much the organization respects and values them and their critical role. This
way you will inspire agents to keep doing the kinds of things that increase
customer satisfaction and boost customer experience. </p>



<p>Also, your reward should not come in the form of a cupcake,
pizza, and balloons.&nbsp; They do not quite
convey the message that you value your agents. Fusion has a few suggestions: </p>



<ul><li>A Wall of Fame featuring agents who have achieved excellence in key areas last month</li><li>A points-for-performance program, where agents who excel receive points that can be redeemed for merchandise</li><li>Peer recognition such as “<em>You rock!</em>” stickers or a pack of chocolates to peers who show outstanding effort in making a customer happy. </li><li>Honoring agents during Customer Service Week, and other such recognition.</li><li>Rewarding the best performers quarterly in a small ceremony where the CEO congratulates them can be great.</li></ul>



<h3>6. Ask for agent
feedback</h3>



<p>You must make your agents feel valued and heard.&nbsp; Therefore, you need to ask for their opinion,
suggestions, and feedbacks. This also has other advantages. Often agents can
notice common issues and come up with easy solutions. Their feedback can help
your business resolve underlying issues.&nbsp;
All employees need to feel valued and believe they have a say in the
future of the business. 

These are a few tried and true agent engagement
tips that Fusion has put to work with brilliant results.&nbsp; Do you have such tips? Share with us in the

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;In today’s highly
competitive customer service industry, customers are more demanding and
powerful than before. They are also more knowledgeable and tech-savvy than
ever. Therefore, to impress them and keep their business, you need to have
impeccable customer service with omnichannel and consistent support. </p>



<p>Today the best-in-class companies deliver consistent
messages to customers across all channels and a majority of customers dislike
repeating their queries. So, at present, omnichannel customer service is the
key to meeting customer expectation and even surpassing it. Here are 5
omnichannel customer service tips that can help you get started: </p>



<h3>1. Focus on
mobile-based service</h3>



<p>&nbsp;In 2019, not being
able to offer uncompromised support via mobile is not only unacceptable but
also self-sabotaging for a business.&nbsp; In
a time when <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/shopping-lists-how-mobile-helps-consumers-tick-all-the-boxes.html">87%</a>
of customers actually use mobile devices to make purchases, businesses must
insist on having a quality mobile-based customer service in place. Or else they
must face the wrath of their frustrated customers.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Here’s how you can improve your customer service via mobile:</p>



<ul><li>Provide your customers with mobile-friendly
FAQs, documentation and self-support videos.</li><li>Your mobile website/app landing page must
display your customer service button prominently.</li><li>Give your customer an easy way to contact
customer support from the mobile. It can be prominent, but non-intrusive
dial-for-support or live-chat-for-support button that lets them communicate
with you without leaving the page. </li><li>Single-tap sensitive customer service links are
preferable.</li><li>A real-time tracking system for mobile-based
customer service queries is also important.</li></ul>



<h3>2. Reduce your social
media response time</h3>



<p>Customers today are fond of instant resolutions.&nbsp; That is why they prefer social media
platforms (especially Twitter) to catch the attention of companies and have
them resolve customer service issues promptly.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-research/42-percent-of-consumers-complaining-in-social-media-expect-60-minute-response-time/">study</a>,
42% of the participants said they expected companies to respond to social media
mentions within 60 minutes.&nbsp; </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Social-customer-support.jpg" alt="social customer support" class="wp-image-6387" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Social-customer-support.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Social-customer-support-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>



<p>Here’s how to do it:</p>



<ul><li>Understand your customers’ expectations when
they post their queries on social media, anticipate their needs and then
address their concerns.</li><li>Aim to respond to all queries within the first
60 minutes.&nbsp; Even if you cannot offer a
solution in that time frame, acknowledging the issue and assuring the customer
of a response can go a long way.&nbsp; </li><li>Set up keyword tracking for your social media
pages and never miss any customer’s comments.</li><li>Provide seamless customer support by integrating
social media with live chat.</li></ul>



<h3>3. Offer live chat
assistance for priority customers</h3>



<p>Every business needs to prioritize their enterprise and
high-level customers and therefore must offer the quick-resolve routes that
present the least hassles. In these cases, a face-to-face call or live chat can
be their best aid to boost customer experience.</p>



<p>According to a Forrester <a href="https://www.ama.org/documents/how-b2b-marketers-leveraging-live-chat-increase-sales.pdf">study</a>,
interactive chat can result in as much as a 120% ROI in a 6-month payback
period. </p>



<p>How to use live chat assistance to keep priority customers
happy</p>



<ul><li>Install a reliable live chat on your website and
app across devices.</li><li>Create a flexible script with room for
improvisation as per the customer’s needs. A list of conversation points can be
helpful too. </li><li>Use a CRM to store important information about
customers that you can refer to for context before attending a customer’s call.</li><li>Keep product manuals and resources ready to send
across to your customers when required during your call.</li><li>Allow customers to lead the call with their
requirements but do not allow them to deviate from the topic.</li></ul>



<h3>4. Enable self-service
via easy-to-use FAQs and documentation</h3>



<p>According to a Zendesk <a href="http://cdn.zendesk.com/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf">study</a>,
50% of customers want to resolve their issues by themselves, without having to involve
a customer support team. They cost your customer service team the least and
turn better cost-to-profit ratios. Such customers can be satiated with
self-serve FAQs, documentation and video content.</p>



<p>How to create optimized FAQs and documentation</p>



<ul><li>Make your FAQs comprehensive, organized, and
easy to navigate.</li><li>A/B test for your FAQ and documentation landing
pages and optimize for the best design and ease-of-use. </li><li>Create excellent copy that offers an excellent
self-service experience. </li></ul>



<h3>5. Set up an email
automation workflow</h3>



<p>Email should be part of your customer service system. It’s
easy to manage, still effective and can resolve a good number of your
customers’ queries. And with CRMs that offer email automation workflows, email
customer service has become an easy to manage customer service channel. </p>



<p>How to use email automation workflows to enable flawless
customer service</p>



<ul><li>Keep your automation workflows under frequent
checks, and tweak email drafts and automation schedules as and when required. </li><li>Use an actual email for replies so your
customers feel cared for and can interact with your automated messages.</li><li>If you resolve common issues in a completely
automated fashion, you will only have to take care of any unusual activity as
and when they occur.</li></ul>



<p>These are a few ways you can improve customer experience through multichannel communication. The key to success of a customer service system, omnichannel, multichannel, or otherwise, lies in the proper understanding of what the customer wants and needs, empathizing with them, and delivering prompt resolution with a bit of personal touch.  Even with the right technology, a customer service system is sure to fail if it cannot feel the pain points of your customers and empathize with them.</p>



<p>A healthy dose of empathy, personalization, and prompt resolution at the right time through the right channel can give a good boost customer experience and earn your business some loyal customers. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A well-managed and efficient call center can be a big help
in making the business get more customers and retain the existing ones. They
are directly responsible for maintaining the company’s image in the eyes of the
target clientele. </p>



<p>A call center agent is often the first point of contact for
the customers. therefore, they must shoulder the responsibility of customer
satisfaction and deliver best in class service. While there is no absolute
formula to deliver the best customer experience, a few tried and tested methods
can ensure that every client interaction ends in a positive note for the
customer as well as for the agent.</p>



<p>It goes without saying that customer experience is going to
be the buzzword in 2019. Here is why:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">86%</a>
of buyers are willing to pay more for a great customer experience</li><li><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/future-of-customer-experience.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">73%</a>
of buyers point to customer experience as an important factor in purchasing
decisions</li><li><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/advisory-services/publications/consumer-intelligence-series/pwc-consumer-intelligence-series-customer-experience.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">65%</a>
of buyers find a positive experience with a brand to be more influential than
great advertising</li></ul>



<p>So, can a call center <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html">deliver positive customer experience</a> that matters? Yes, it can. Here are 5 easy steps for improving the experience of the customers interacting with a call center:</p>



<h3>1. Minimum On-Hold
Times during Calls</h3>



<p>Putting a customer on-hold for a long period of time is a
call center bane that drives customers crazy.&nbsp;
The customers do not like to stay on hold, period. They don’t care if
their issues actually need time to be resolved and the agent can’t help but
make them wait.&nbsp; To most of them a call
center should be a one-stop solution for all their problems. They want a quick
solution and they want it right now. </p>



<p>While eliminating waiting time is impossible, a call center
must try to keep the on-hold time to a bare minimum. Remember, the shorted the
wait time, the happier a customer is.&nbsp;
It’s that simple.</p>



<h3>2. Understand who the
customers are</h3>



<p>Knowing a customer demographic is not enough, you customer
service teams must also know who are their customers. Try putting a face to
your customer or creating customer personas – it will help your customer
service team to understand your customers better.</p>



<p>Your customer personas can be as detailed as you want them
to be. By creating personas, your agents can put a face to their customers and
better understand how they can assist and improve customer experience.</p>



<h3>3. Recognize the
stage of customer journey for each customer</h3>



<p>A call center agent must not interact with each customer the
same way. Rather they should use the CRM to pinpoint the stage of every
customers’ journey and personalize their interaction to improve the customer
experience.</p>



<p>Define the customer actions that fall within each stage of
the customer journey. This will help your call center customer service team to
quickly recognize and know how to approach your leads and clients.</p>



<h3>4. Forge an emotional
bond</h3>



<p>The biggest chunk of consumers today are millennials. And
millennials don’t just look for a product, they want their values to be aligned
with the brands they shop from. They want value for money, as well as great customer
experience.</p>



<p>While pricing is not something your customer service team
can control, they can deliver everything else.&nbsp;
They can forge an emotional connection with the customer by empathizing
with them, telling them their side of story and even throwing in a
much-appreciated surprise.&nbsp; This
connection will help your agents anticipate the customers’ needs better and
deliver a much better experience.</p>



<h3>5. Make it easy for
customers</h3>



<p>In this age of competition, customers are being spoiled with
one-click checkout, instant customer service through chatbots, next-day
shipping. These services simplify the purchase process for customers and reduce
customer effort in an attempt to maximize sales. A customer service team too
can reduce customer effort in so many ways. They can- </p>



<ul><li>Offer to call back in case of disconnection</li><li>Clearly Understand customer queries </li><li>See to it that the customers do not have to
repeat themselves</li><li>Provide helpful material after service</li><li>Solve customers’ issues the first time around</li><li>Offer to answer a customer query through the
preferred communication channel of a customer</li></ul>



<p>A customer service team can make the process of purchase or
issue resolution a cakewalk for the customers, resulting in a high-quality
customer experience.&nbsp; </p>



<p>In todays competitive world customer experience is gold. Being
the first point of contact for customers, it is up to the call center customer
service team to deliver the customer experience each customer deserves. While
their interactions can be short, it can be an excellent opportunity to boost
customer experience.</p>

<p>While call center management is a mammoth task, following the latest and most innovative trends can help a call center keep delivering quality customer service to its customers. And while trends come and go with each passing year, only the most effective ones can help a call center improve. </p>



<p>As 2019 is approaching, one must look into the call center trends that will have a big impact on call centers the coming year. </p>



<h2>Trend 1: Customer Experience is of Prime Importance</h2>



<p>By now every call center should be aware of the power of a positive customer experience. </p>



<p>From the biggest corporations to the smallest businesses today know that a poor customer experience is all it takes to lose a customer forever while consistent bad service can ruin any business for good, especially with so many competitors around.</p>



<p>On the other hand, customers today are willing to pay more for better service. According to one <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/RightNow/2011-customer-experience-impact-report">survey</a> 86% of buyers would part with 25% extra cash if another company treated them better.</p>



<p>For this reason, customer experience has become an important aspect that call centers can no longer ignore. On the contrary, they are placing more and more emphasis on treating each caller to the highest standard of service to ensure repeat business. </p>



<h2>Trend 2: The Importance of First Call Resolution </h2>



<p>First call resolution is great for both the call center and the customers alike. </p>



<p>For this, agents should be encouraged to get the first call right. While there will be calls that are more difficult to resolve than others, it’s important to provide customers with the very best quality of care possible every single time.</p>



<p>Monitoring call center agents’ interactions with customers will help a business identify mistakes that leaves the caller unsatisfied and/or frustrated.  With proper identification and training such problems can be avoided in future. </p>



<h2>Trend 3: Social Network is an Important Customer Service Channel</h2>



<p>Social networks like Facebook and Twitter continue to become a key channel in customer service.</p>



<p>As an alternative to calling or emailing, prospective and existing buyers can contact a business’s support team through their social accounts. Call centers should be incorporating this aspect of the customer experience into their operations to make sure that the consumers can reach them on as many channels as possible.</p>



<p>Handling queries through various social media channels can actually be the fastest method. However, as the conversation takes place in a public forum, one must bear the best practices in mind.  On social media quick and efficient responses are the key. Ignoring this channel, on the other hand, can ruin a company’s brand reputation. </p>



<h2>Trend 4: Every Channel Matters</h2>



<p>Customers today expect companies to respond through the same channel they use to interact with the company. So, if they interact with a call center via phone or chat, they would not appreciate the company replying through email.</p>



<p>Therefore, call centers should be ready to incorporate that aspect of customer experience into their operation and give equal importance to all customer interaction channels.  Only then they will be able to provide the customers with the multi-channel customer service that modern customers deserve.</p>



<h2>Trend 5: Employee Management</h2>



<p>Most of the time call centers fail to meet customer’s needs due to disengaged agents who lack power and freedom to improvise or take a decision. Therefore, empowering the agents with knowledge, giving them some decision making freedom and engaging them through a reward-based culture is very important. A company can also arrange for interim training wherever needed to train their agents better.</p>



<p>These are some of the most important call center trends that will help a call center to become successful in 2019 and beyond. </p>
