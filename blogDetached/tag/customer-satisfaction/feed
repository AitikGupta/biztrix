<p>You have been told that proactive chat is a great way to up the customer satisfaction level. However, proactive chats too can ruin otherwise good customer experience.</p>



<p>Here’s an example – while browsing a site the live chat agent starts an interaction with you stating its various products and features that are already given on the webpage and do not give you a chance to convey what you are looking for. How would you feel then? </p>



<p>It is natural to get annoyed at such behavior. Proactive chat
only enhances the customer experience when it is used the way it is supposed
to.&nbsp; Your agents must know what works the
best and what does not.&nbsp; To save you the
time, Fusion brings you the best tips and tricks to turn a bad online
experience into a winning one.</p>



<h2>1. Leverage analytics to find the right time</h2>



<p>The key to <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html">providing quality customer service through proactive chat</a> is using the analytics to your benefit. You can use analytics to determine many factors like:</p>



<ul><li>Average browsing time of a visitor.</li><li>His/her behavior for every page of the website.</li></ul>



<p>Based on the information gathered through analytics, you can
decide the appropriate wait time for sending out a proactive message.</p>



<h2>2. Track referring URLs</h2>



<p>In the present age, your work does not end after placing promotional links at different places online, you need to also keep track of its aftermath.  Tracking referring URLs can create great conversion opportunities. You must identify the users who came to your website through the referral links and send out proactive chat invitations to them.</p>



<p>In case they came to your site grab some promotional offers featured on the referring website, a proactive chat is the best way to direct them to the offer page. Proactive chat can also be used to resolve any other query they might have regarding the offer. </p>



<h2>3. Provide 24/7 customer support</h2>



<p>Customers these days expect instant query resolution. Moreover, they expect round the clock support 365 days a year from you.  You must be there to guide/assist them at any point of the day.  And that means having some proven customer touch points on a 24/7 basis.  These touch points include email, VOIP channels, social media platforms, live chat and more.</p>



<p>In this situation, proactive chat can be your best option &#8211; it helps help you to know your potential customers and their queries before they approach you and provide the most satisfactory solution. </p>



<h2>4. Use proactive chat tools for smarter communications</h2>



<p>As visual learners, your customers will learn better when you
explain you explain facts about your products and services through demos. You
can use this to your advantage and employ tools like live voice chat, live
video chat to educate them.&nbsp; You can also
redirect your customers to relevant pages using co-browsing or proactively
offer them links to support videos through chat.</p>



<p>These tips can help you improve your lackluster proactive chat
support into an effective tool to improve customer satisfaction. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>First contact resolution (FCR) is a critical key performance indicator (<a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-technologies-boost-up-the-kpi.html">KPI</a>) in measuring both the quality of the customer experience as well as the efficiency of a contact center. According to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/increase-efficiency-drive-down-cost-and-improve-customer-satisfaction-all-at-the-same-time/">research</a>, a 1% improvement in FCR can mean a 1% improvement in customer satisfaction, too. However, it can be a challenge both in terms of measurement and continuous improvement.</p>



<p>When a customer has to repeatedly contact a business to resolve an issue, they get frustrated and very disappointed with the service.  On the contrary, when an agent resolves the issue in the very first contact, it creates a better customer experience and marks the operational efficiency of a call center.</p>



<p>Measurement of first contact resolution typically comes down to the customers’ feedback on whether the inquiry was resolved to their satisfaction. You may need to use a number of different tracking methods in order to capture this information.</p>



<p>With a little effort from your end, FCR can be boosted.  Want to know about them? Here we have 8 ways to improve your call center FCR:</p>



<h2>1. Train call center agents to handle most queries</h2>



<p>A skills matrix helps you see the abilities of your agents at a glance. Training programs need to be tailored accordingly with the goal of nurturing and developing your team. A knowledge base for frequently asked questions can help less skilled agents can easily find out ways to resolve common issues.</p>



<h2>2. Use call routing technology to find the right agent on the first call</h2>



<p>Skill-based routing should be there to ensure customers are matched up with the best agent for the call.  Calls should be based on language proficiency or product knowledge and aligned your agents’ skills in real-time. Intelligent call routing or data-directed routing lets you interrogate data within your CRM and factor it into the routing process. </p>



<p>This way, a customer with an ongoing, active complaint could be routed directly to a supervisor. Immediate callbacks to customers who abandon a queue or get disconnected can also help you turn bad customer experience into a service recovery opportunity.</p>



<h2>3. Eliminate conflicting KPIs that could work against FCR</h2>



<p>If your staff is being measured for Average Handle Time (AHT), it can have a negative impact on successful First Call Resolution. It happens quite often and therefore needs addressing. Eliminating these conflicting KPIs can help agents focus on FCR.</p>



<h2>4. Use Incentive to boost FCR</h2>



<p>Make your agents aware of the importance of first contact resolution and good customer service. If you want your agents to focus on FCR, it needs to be deeply ingrained within the company culture. You can use incentives to motivate agents to perform against your FCR goals.</p>



<h2>5. Measure First Call Resolution consistently</h2>



<p>A sophisticated call recording system is essential to quality monitoring and call ratings. However, post-call customer surveys too can be used for measuring first call resolution as only the customer can provide an honest perspective on whether they feel their issue has been resolved. Asking the customers about their experience on social media too can help you get an honest answer. You need to adopt a multi-touchpoint approach to measuring first contact resolution to get the correct picture of customer satisfaction.</p>



<h2>6. Encourage feedback from staff</h2>



<p>Encourage staff feedback and make it a part of your operation.  It will help you understand whether an issue is recurring or not. Acting upon the inputs from the agents will help you nip a recurring problem at the bud.</p>



<h2>7. Check your IVR system</h2>



<p>You should review your IVR system from time to time to ensure that it is up-t-date and getting the right customer to the right place without delay.</p>



<h2>8. Tweak the scripting process to boost FCR</h2>



<p>Dynamic agent scripting that integrates with your <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/can-you-build-better-call-center-metrics-with-crm.html">CRM system can help</a> agents to adequately handle customer issues during the first call resolution.</p>



<p>These are the eight ways you can work on to improve your call center FCR, efficiency, and customer experience.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every business faces the issue with accounts receivable every once in a while irrespective their size.  And yet, most of them feel as though it will affect the customer relationship negatively if they ask for or demand payment from the customer for the products/services provided.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this popular belief is not at all true.</p>
<p>Your customers will not get disappointed or leave your company just because you asked for payment for products/services provided. They know that they owe you. If your customers are leaving you, it’s not because you’re asking them to pay their bills, but it may have something to do with the way you go about collecting invoices.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, better accounts receivable management can considerably improve customer satisfaction and retention.</p>
<p>By implementing <a href="http://www.ofm.wa.gov/resources/misc/Receivable_Collection_Best_Practices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">debt collection best practices</a>, you can not only provide better customer service and increase customer satisfaction, but also you can increase your cash flow and grow your business.</p>
<p>Even if you have a few difficult customers who don’t want to pay, a majority of your customers truly do want to pay outstanding account receivable.  However, sometimes things do not go as planned and they fail to pay you on time.</p>
<h3>Why do you want to improve account receivable management?</h3>
<p>After all the time, effort and money it took to turn a prospect into a customer, you would not want to lose them over an unpaid invoice, right? You and your team have already given so much effort to retain these customers. Blowing the chance of repeat purchases because of a frustrating collection experience is not a wise decision. Also it takes a huge cost to acquiring a new customer.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is better to improve the collection experience by managing accounts receivable better and keep the existing customers happier.</p>
<h3>How can improved accounts receivable management make customers happier?</h3>
<p>It’s quite simple actually! <a href="http://www.vitalsolutions.net/" target="_blank">Good accounts receivable management</a> will make their lives much easier, help them remember to send in their checks, and make the process easy.</p>
<p>Here are a few simple things you can begin with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a plan. The Credit Research Foundation estimates that <a href="http://e2banytime.com/docs/White_Paper_-_How_To_Develop_A_Business_Credit_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">only 20% of credit departments have formalized policies with well-defined goals</a>.</li>
<li>Centralize all data and information</li>
<li>Provide agents with timely and accurate information to avoid any misunderstanding</li>
<li>Define roles. It is important to know who has which responsibility</li>
<li>Determine KPIs to see how your business is doing in overall collection scenario.</li>
<li>Manage your resources</li>
<li>Define dispute resolution procedure</li>
<li>Focus on important accounts</li>
<li>Be proactive and invoice the parties earlier to let them know it is time for them to pay their dues</li>
<li>Make sure invoices are complete and correct</li>
<li>Include your terms clearly on invoice</li>
<li>Have a standard system for follow-up (letters, emails, phone calls, etc.)</li>
<li>Escalate troubled accounts</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, if you have a small AR department or do not have the right tools for the job, you will find AR management a little difficult. After all, software and communication templates may save the situation but they will never be able to replace a personalized communication. In such case, to deal with accounts receivable, you might have to hire debt collection agencies that can deal with the situation expertly and make your customers happier.</p>
<p>Remember, accounts receivable is your last communication with the customer on a sale, and it can have a huge impact on whether or not they choose to do business with you again.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the world of call centers, customer satisfaction is considered as one of the most important things that exist these days. As a result, the way call centers treated customers in the past have also changed dramatically.</p>
<p>For example – there were days when call centers used to get as many customers on the line as possible, causing some disappointments among the customers. Today, call centers have taken some serious measures to drive up customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>However, even when most call centers began to understand the importance of customer satisfaction, they faced several problems achieving their goals in 2014. According to a new <a href="http://www.smartcustomerservice.com/Articles/News-Features/Customer-Satisfaction-Inches-Higher-Increasing-Sales-Opportunities-%28QandA%29-102482.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">report</a> by the CFI Group, the same call centers have a very good chance to rebound somewhat in 2015.</p>
<p>This report from CFI group is being published for its eighth year in 2015. As per the report, not only customer satisfaction has gone up in 2014 but also there’s been a steady growth in technological advances. This made it much easier for businesses to opt for a contact center that aimed to help as many customers as possible while still ensuring that they are actually helping.</p>
<p>This data is derived from over 1,500 consumers spread across six major industries by the Contact Center Satisfaction Index (CCSI). In the year 2014, the CCSI reached 72 out of 100, which is a three-point increase from the result of 2013. Unfortunately, it is also the third lowest score ever since the index came into being.</p>
<p>It should be duly noted that with the advancement of mobile technology, more and more <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/customer-service-5-thing-customers-want-from-kishore-saraogi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">customers are looking for</a> a multi-channel or <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/deliver-optimum-customer-experience-within-an-omni-channel-strategy.html" target="_blank">Omni-channel customer experience</a>, and a prompt and effective service. In the wake of growing consumer demand, more and more call centers are updating their technology to satisfy their clientele. They have tried numerous ways to drive 100% customer satisfaction. However, so far no one has been able to perfect their score.</p>
<p>However, in 2015, a majority of contact centers are working really hard to find a way to keep customers happy. As a large section of the contact center industry is aiming for a perfect customer satisfaction score, they have rolled out every type of new technology. In spite of these efforts, 57% of the contact center would rather keep on using the telephone than any other communication channels.</p>
<p>How much an agent at any call center can deal with a caller is also an important aspect to consider. After all, the end users are looking forward to getting answers to their questions from the operators even when the answers are not part of the script given to the agent.</p>
<p>In such a situation, a contact center may give the agents the power to take a decision on the spot. Having agents who care about their role and the callers are two aspects that when working together can improve the customer satisfaction immensely, which can result in better business, more sales, and a positive brand image.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virtual queuing is a dominant technology that can improve your call center in more ways than one. Virtual queuing is in existence for over a decade and yet a large section of the customer service industry seems to be blissfully ignoring any knowledge of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_queue" target="_blank">Virtual queuing</a> simply means holding a caller’s place in line – “<em>virtually</em>.” This enables the customer to stay in the queue without having to stay on the phone. In most cases, virtual queuing is done by collecting the caller’s phone number and then giving them a call back when an agent is available to take a call. With virtual queuing the concept of hold time can be eliminated.</p>
<p>Here are 5 ways your call center can benefit using virtual queuing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong>Increasing Customer Satisfaction</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone knows that waiting on hold is the most boring and annoying thing a customer has to suffer while contacting a customer care. In fact, it is the most common complaint of the customers about a call center, according to a <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/06/what-bugs-you-most-about-your-doctor/index.htm" target="_blank">survey</a> done by Consumer Reports on “Top Gripes” about phone-based customer service.</p>
<p>Therefore, to improve customer satisfaction, virtual queuing can be the best possible option. By giving callers the option to receive a call-back as an alternative of waiting on hold, you can remove one of the most annoying parts of the contact center experience.</p>
<p>By offering a call-back, a company can show its customers that it values their time.  This shows a brand in a good light. In a recent research conducted by Forrester, it is stated that 75% of customers find call-back option “highly appealing”. According to another <a href="http://www.plumvoice.com/resources/blog/3-studies-show-shouldnt-put-customers-hold/" target="_blank">research</a> conducted by SoftwareAdvice.com, 61% of customers may prefer a call-back to waiting on hold, every single time.</p>
<p>A study by <a href="http://www.sourcewire.com/news/51358/as-latest-yougov-surveys-show-a-good-contact-centre-experience" target="_blank">YouGov</a> shows that 76% of participants said, “Just one unpleasant contact center experience was likely to make them take their business elsewhere”.  As per <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Desk/50-facts-that-will-make-businesses-rethink-their-customer-service" target="_blank">Gartner</a>, businesses that put the customer experience first produce 60% higher profits than their competitors.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong>Reducing Abandon Rate</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Call abandonment not only increases the dissatisfaction in the customers but also leads to higher repeat calls that slow down the call center system.</p>
<p>These days, customer’s expectation from a brand is skyrocketing, while their tolerance for waiting on hold is hitting rock bottom. In fact, 60% of customers are not willing to wait on hold for over one minute, according to a recent research by <a href="http://www.velaro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/velaro-customer-service-infographic-fullsize.jpg">Velaro</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/call-hold-time.jpg" alt="Call holding time" width="600" height="260" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6088" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/call-hold-time.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/call-hold-time-300x130.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>This statistics is sure to give you a fair idea about the increasing rate of call abandonment, which rose from 5% in 2003 to more than 13% in 2010. And every business owner has a fair idea that with each abandoned call the First Call Resolution (FCR) rates also drops. But that’s not all. The entire experience leaves a bad impression on the mind of the customers and eventually compels them to opt for a competing brand.</p>
<p>Let’s face it! Your customers get tired of hearing “<em>your call is important to us, please stay on hold</em>” for the nth number of time.</p>
<p>So, what’s the solution? Simple as it is, you will have to lower hold times to lower call abandonment rate. And in order to do so, you need you need enough budget to hire more employees until the call abandonment rate drops. Now, that does not sound very realistic either, does it? There’s the cost factor. In such a situation virtual queuing is the only sane option that will bring call abandonment rate down.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong>Improving First Call Resolution</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>First Call Resolution (FCR) is critical to an efficient call center operation. Handling every issue with one call leads to</p>
<ul>
<li>More efficient use of agent time</li>
<li>Higher caller satisfaction</li>
<li>Fewer inbound calls</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, a good first call resolution rate represents both <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/7-ways-improve-inbound-call-center-performance-bidisha-gupta" target="_blank">quality and efficiency of a call center</a>.  When virtual queuing is applied, an agent can contact the customer and listen to their problem without putting them on hold or keeping them waiting. This leads to more first call resolution.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2><strong>Smoothing Out Spikes in Call Volume</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to holidays, bad weather and special promotions call centers often experience peaks in their call volume.  Dealing with these spikes can be a challenge while delivering a positive customer experience. During these peaks, the Average Speed to Answer (ASA) goes up increasing abandon rate.</p>
<p>During these peak seasons, the call center does not hire additional staff, and there will be excess agents in non-peak days. In such a situation, virtual queuing can help call center each out the pressure of call volume.</p>
<p>With scheduled call-backs, customers can be given future time slots for their call. With proper configuration, these time slots can be tuned to even out the call volume throughout the period.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2><strong>Reduce Telco Cost</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With the traditional approach, a PSTN line gets occupied for the entire duration of a call on hold. On a toll-free DID, this can carry higher per-minute rates. By swapping hold-time with a call-back, those lines can be freed and the number of total minutes consumed can be reduced. It can also bring down the total number of lines required. This reduces the cost considerably.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. When an agent gives the customer a call-back, he makes an outbound call with lower per-minute rates than the inbound toll-free rate. For a call center that handles millions of calls per year, the savings can even cover the cost of the virtual queuing system.</p>
<p>With these amazing benefits, virtual call queuing shows the promise of revolutionizing the future of call centers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Omni-channel has become the recent buzzword in customer service. In order to treat the demanding clientele in this highly competitive market, almost all <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/retail-services-call-centers-add-more-customers-to-your-shopping-cart.html">retail businesses are opting for Omni-channel customer experience</a>.</p>
<p>Today’s tech-savvy customers have a penchant for online shopping.  From their online shopping habits, retail can know a lot about their choices.  In an Omni-channel environment where the data integration is seamless, one in-store assistant should be able to utilize the data to help those clients pick their products.</p>
<p>The same thing applies when a customer communicated with a brand. If the customer wishes to change their communication channel and move on to chat from email, a customer service representative should be able to follow the communication across different platforms so that the customer does not have to repeat themselves.</p>
<p>And that is where contact centers come into the picture. When investing in new channels for customer service, every company should ensure that their contact centers are on the same page with its other channels and service offering.</p>
<p>According to Aberdeen research, a company can enjoy major business benefits by integrating their contact centers within their Omni-channel strategy.  At a recent CRMXchange <a href="http://www.crmxchange.com/webcast/omnichannel/sapoct2014.asp" target="_blank">webinar</a>, Omer Minkara of Aberdeen Group presented research findings on the topic. Moving from multichannel to an Omni-channel experience is a very relevant topic today.</p>
<p>As a major part of the customer communication takes place through contact centers these days, it is time to think how an Omni-channel environment can benefit customer service in contact centers. Let us take a look at how the Omni-channel approach can enhance contact center performance:</p>
<h2>Customer Satisfaction</h2>
<p>According to Aberdeen, companies that integrate their contact centers within their Omni-channel strategy often experience an increased level of customer satisfaction which can be noted by a higher customer retention rate and a higher customer lifetime value.</p>
<p>Integrating the contact center within the Omni-channel strategy allows them to provide a consistent all-encompassing state-of-the-art customer service, and that is one major reason for the increased customer satisfaction.</p>
<h2>First Contact Resolution Rate and Average Handling Time</h2>
<p>Other major benefits include improved first contact resolution and shorter waiting time – two of the most essential aspects of customer satisfaction. Customers today frequently use mobile apps and visit web stores. They do not have the patience to wait in a queue. For this reason, an Omni-channel contact center suits them the best.</p>
<p>As a result of seamless data integration of Omni-channel strategy, quick resolution of customer’s problem has also become a possibility.  Equipped with the data from past customer interaction and their purchasing history, a contact center agent is better suited to help the customers. It also allows them to resolve customers’ queries faster.</p>
<p>As per Aberdeen research, <a href="http://www.sap.com/bin/sapcom/en_us/downloadasset.2014-06-jun-06-15.the-business-value-of-integrating-the-contact-center-within-your-omni-channel-strategy-pdf.bypassReg.html" target="_blank">contact center agents spend 14% of their time searching for data</a> from different systems. Unifying the relevant data on a single screen improves both first call resolution rates and average handling time.</p>
<h2>Average Waiting Time</h2>
<p>The first contact resolution rate can be increased by equipping the contact center agents with access to relevant customer data. It frees the agent’s time that they can then invest in offering quality service to the customers. Not having to look for data also allows them to handle more calls, which leads to shorter wait times for customers.</p>
<p>Apart from that, by integrating all communication channels in the same solution, the companies can be able to deliver a consistent, speedy customer service through all those channels. With access to adequate consumer data, it can also be possible to route the contacts to the right agent in no time.</p>
<p>To sum it all, integrating your contact center within an Omni- channel strategy makes the contact center operations easier and helps agents meet the customer expectations by offering quick and high-quality customer service.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;<a class="zem_slink" title="May Day" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Day" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">May Day</a>&#8216; the day for laborious and diligent employees. Though call center employees work in a healthy environment, but they too toil hard to achieve perfection in each call. Generating quality leads is the ambition and in this tough situation having the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-technologies-boost-up-the-kpi.html">right KPIs is necessary</a>.</p>
<p>Saluting the employees in May Day, we are going to discuss how we improve the call center performance with the help of them and right KPIs.</p>
<h3>Fusion and Their Employees Setting the Right KPI</h3>
<p>Fusion has a list of services under their banner and <i>customer service</i> is the most essential among them. We do follow certain steps to make our customer service practice outperform others. Today with the use of multiple channels, we are able to give quality leads and have a higher utilization rate.</p>
<p>Routing of calls to the right agents and generation of instant feedback, allowing seamless channel to pop up on the unified desktops, and greatly contributes to better performance.</p>
<p>As Fusion has turned into a strategic organization in these nine long years so, incorporating the best practices are important for us. Today these practices are the face of your organization. So we tend to give the best possible customer service and that too cost-effectively.</p>
<p>Well, the question that is going to arise in this situation is – How Fusion agents achieves the goal of 99.9% customer satisfaction?</p>
<p>According to the Whitepapers shared on the website of CIO Summit by the <a href="http://www.ciosummitna.com/media/whitepapers/2012/Empirix.pdf" target="_blank">Empirix Inc</a> shows that six different KPIs contribute much to the overall performance of the call centers. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>First Call Resolution (FCR)</li>
<li>Customer Satisfaction</li>
<li>Higher Utilization Rate</li>
<li>Cost per Contact</li>
<li>Call Abandonment Rate</li>
<li>Call Quality Score</li>
</ul>
<p>These leading practices help to find the KPIs to quantify the impact. These leading practices have helped Fusion to measure the performance in a relative way. The difference in performance in BPO leaders and BPO laggards summarized below in this table looks:</p>
<table style="border:solid 2px #4BACC6; width:620px; text-align:center" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPI)</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">BPO LEADERS PERFORMANCE </td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">BPO LAGGARDS PERFORMANCE </td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">DIFFERENCE</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background:#D2EAF1;">
<td>First Call Resolution (FCR)</td>
<td>81%</td>
<td>77.0%</td>
<td>5.2%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Customer Satisfaction</td>
<td>87.2%</td>
<td>68.5%</td>
<td>27.3%</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background:#D2EAF1;">
<td>Higher Utilization Rate</td>
<td>62%</td>
<td>38.2%</td>
<td>62.3%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cost per Contact</td>
<td>$4.4</td>
<td>$5.1</td>
<td>15.8%</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background:#D2EAF1;">
<td>Call Abandonment Rate</td>
<td>2.6%</td>
<td>3.3%</td>
<td>26.7%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Call Quality Score </td>
<td>89.0%</td>
<td>74.7%</td>
<td>19.1%</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>From the above statistics, you can infer that maintenance of the following 6 KPIs will help to meet a balanced scorecard for customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we are having access to high-level of support just at the touch of a button. We also add ways to transfer and escalate the calls that make sure that your customers get higher satisfaction scores and FCR.</p>
<p><b><i>What are those innovations that help our agent to deliver positive results to the customers?</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Installation of ACD (automatic call distribution) system, routes calls to the right agent. This is an important aspect of the FCR.</li>
<li>Preparations of call transfer rules that are handy, give access to multiple agents, and give instant support to all customer queries.</li>
<li>Better utilization with innovative tools helps to keep the operation cost lower and workforce motivated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further study by <a href="http://www.benchmarkportal.com/public/pdf/Sample-12-KPI-Industry-Benchmark-Report.pdf" target="_blank">Benchmark Portal</a> affirms that the use of low-cost communication channels like Web, email, self-service helps the agents to solve problems faster and in an easier way. More use of at-home agents to lower cost and improve contact center convenience.</p>
<p>The result of analysis shows that the daily operations not only lowers the operational cost but also improves the customer experience. Moreover, these results in building organized and relevant leading practices.</p>
<p>Employees give their best at every call; and with the assistance of intelligent tools boost the productivity and result ins improved customer satisfaction rate. We thus salute the hard work of our employees!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a part of prestigious contact center management, we understand that the job is not something for the weak at heart. Dealing with everyday problems is the basic task of the outsourcing companies. Maybe at times, you have to deal with the multiple stakeholders. Satisfying customers, clients and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-boost-up-the-employee-happiness-meter.html">employees</a> are measurable tasks. It leaves the contact center management stressed and pressured.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is must for the contact center managers and team leaders to reduce their tension and run a high-performance operation. How to maintaining the both minimize tension and accelerate the performance?</p>
<p>What may be essential to achieve this target? &#8211; Building up of the leadership culture is essential for achieving this target.</p>
<h3><strong>What is the Leadership Culture?</strong></h3>
<p>According to a survey by <a href="http://www.ccl.org/leadership/pdf/solutions/TYO.pdf" target="_blank">Center for Creative Leadership</a>, creating a leadership culture is necessary not only for managers and team leaders, but the agents also must agree. They must comply with the 5 key indicators &#8211; <strong>communication</strong>, <strong>principles of ownership</strong>, <strong>planning</strong>, <strong>action and partnership</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Communication</strong></h3>
<p>Make sure that you communicate clearly, when you give an instruction or make a request, do give a proper justification to support your statement. Pick the phone whenever needed, and write down the interpretation of the conversation, as everyone perceives conversations in a different manner. This scribbling down of the conversation will give you clarification of understanding.</p>
<p>Use “we” instead of “I” or “you”.  This helps to remove the defensiveness and potential feelings of blame while talking to a customer.</p>
<h3><strong>Principles of Ownership</strong></h3>
<p>Being a contact center manager if you find some action item is associated with your name, and then own it. If the item is valuable, then follow-up, unless leadership directs you in other way.</p>
<p>Ask people: “How may I help you?”, when you think to deal with them. Remember: a leader also serves!</p>
<h3><strong>Planning</strong></h3>
<p>It is crucial for the contact managers to set goals. At Fusion, we do set goals and try to identify the cycles so that our managers can prepare in advance and deliver before being asked. Be proactive, know the audience and anticipate a response for better results.</p>
<h3><strong>Action</strong></h3>
<p>Do have ‘Plan A’ and ‘Plan B’ both in your hand, if you are going to jump into the action. This ensures effective contact center management. Sometimes action is associated with risk and risk might lead to mistakes. However, inaction is also risky.</p>
<p>When you think to seek something in urgency, do not lose focus. Since, in urgency you will meet only chaos and confusion. Do not react on the stressful situations and keep a strong hold on the clarity and relevance. Do conduct a root analysis on issues to gain a fuller knowledge of the business.</p>
<h3><strong>Partnership</strong></h3>
<p>Customers are everything that a call center has. Not only customers but agents, clients, successors etc all are an essential part of a call center. It is good to balance the things in a right manner and serve the people with the best interest. Everyone might not be happy all the time, but carefully listen to them through <strong>Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)</strong> or <strong>Employee Satisfaction (ESAT)</strong> surveys, exit interviews, focus groups, call recordings etc.</p>
<p>At Fusion, our people the ones who are associated with our contact center actively follow the basic five rules stated above to lessen the stressful operations on the contact center floor.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you mean by customer loyalty? – It is the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/top-3-call-center-practices-that-consumers-prefer.html">desire of the customer</a> to trust, consider and tolerate. This thought of customer loyalty is applicable across all verticals.</p>
<p>Certain industries are able to drive better consumer loyalty across different timeline. Who are these industries? – Contact centers. They are the higher driver of loyalty in different touch points on the macro level in the telecom environment better than a retail chain.</p>
<p>Well, we are not saying that the contact center is not the strong loyalty driver in the retail industry, but over the phone they can build bigger experience. However, the basis for consumer loyalty depends on the in-store experience, and we know that it will bring a broad smile of the face of the customers.</p>
<p>Well, there are issues where we usually do not lose the loyalty towards the company. Like the company to whom we rely may keep us on hold for more than half an hour and resolve the problem for a next half an hour, but still they do not lose the trust of the customer.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are instances where we do not have confidence on our service provider. Cable and internet work well and, we often do not have a problem with them. However, the billing and moving issues may lead to the contact centers, and their customers have a terrible contact center experiences. It drives the loyalty of the customers to a lower margin.</p>
<p>Installing advanced technology, contact centers want to improve their customer loyalty. Thus, the installation of <a class="zem_slink" title="Interactive voice response" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">IVR</a> and Visual IVR took place. Fusion plays a large role in the customer’s perception of the brand and, therefore, the experience needs to be flawless. Fusion thus uses IVR and Visual IVR to accelerate their call center performance.</p>
<p>Efficiency of the IVR comes with the combination of ease and speed. The <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/call-center-outsourcing-become-more-efficient.html">advanced IVR technologies</a> surpass the traditional IVR models. Since, the former gives more opportunity to influence the callers with sophisticated and brand reflecting automation that increase sales and the customer experience.</p>
<p>According to the survey done by the <a href="http://www.pvko.nl/upload/documenten/presentaties/CRM-Association-Gungor.pdf" target="_blank">Platform Voor Klantgericht Ondernemen</a> says, that on an average 20-30% of customers are delightful in keeping up the loyalty with a particular company, yet 10-25% are still disappointing. The survey also says that the negative contact has a stronger effect than the satisfied ones.</p>
<p>With the use of IVR technologies, the performance of the call center has boosted. Take a look at the table below for further details:</p>
<table style="border:solid 2px #4BACC6; width:600px; text-align:center" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center">
<tr>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">

<div align="center"><strong>Customer Loyalty</strong></div>
</td>

<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">19%</td>
<td style="border:solid 1px #4BACC6;">45%</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Fusion believes in the motto – “<em>Positive the Customer Contacts, Stronger the Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty</em>. “</p>
<p>Fusion makes the automated experience seamless and thus our callers are more willing to buy. This helps to increase our customer trust, and if our customer is frustrated, the automated part of the call won’t increase the frustration level.</p>
<p>Thus, for a positive experience and better consumer loyalty, Fusion gives thumbs up for IVR solutions.</p>
