								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our previous blog, we have said that contact center can effectively <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/contact-center-technologies-boost-up-the-kpi.html">influence the Key Performance Indicator</a> (KPI). It is the recent rage for all contact centers. However, they are not created equally. It is a good idea to evaluate the metrics, but the contact centers have to make sure that they are collecting the right one.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>What does the contact centers do as soon as they collect the data?</i></li>
<li><i>What are those data, which contact centers collect?</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The contact center manager’s <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/can-contact-centers-eliminate-call-holding-time.html">focuses on the call handling times</a>, wrap-up time and call scripting measures as these metrics helps to boost contact center performance. However, many argue that they are not the right metrics, which can bring change to contact centers.</p>
<p>Fusion uses the performance metrics that measure from the inside looking out, trying to look on the contact center ability in a turnaround way. The effectiveness thus measured by our customers and not the client companies.</p>
<p>Among that, the most influential KPI is FCR (<a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/how-fcr-is-important-for-customer-service.html"><em>First Call Resolution</em></a>). If you improve the first call rate, then the customer becomes happy with the company whose product they have bought. Moreover, if the agents are able to handle the customers in the first call instead of three, then it cuts the cost by two-third.</p>
<p>According to Oke Eleazu, vice-president of the Institute of Customer Service, who remarked in the survey done on the first call resolution released by <a href="http://www.instituteofcustomerservice.com/files/Panviva%20First%20Call%20Resolution%20Knowledge%20Exchange.pdf" target="_blank">Panviva</a>&#8211; customers refers to connect to that agent who can solve their problems almost instantly. Therefore, the business owners who want their contact center support deliver good customer service must look into the FCR rate of the outsourcing partner. With FCR, you are able to get an actionable measure and thus improve the customer experience.</p>
<p>It is hard to deal with the traditional metrics. Being in the contact center world for years, Fusion knows that, you have many ways to deal with traditional metrics, but most of them are less-scientific methods. Many times, the managers can ask the agent to check off a box at the end of the communication if the problem has been resolved. However, this aspect is subjective as agent may be wrong. Call monitoring is similarly a subjective and labor-intensive method, and even the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/top-10-crm-software-for-better-customer-support-in-2013.html">use of CRM software</a> reduces the agent subjectivity nowadays.</p>
<p>Well the key is something different. At Fusion, we gather the different types of FCR related information, which indicates how frequently the customers contact the company and number of repeat calls made by them.</p>
<h3>Influx of Social Media Channels</h3>
<p>With the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/social-customer-services-personalize-customer-support.html">use of social media</a>, extra customer channels and decentralized contact centers, in the midst of all improving FCR is no doubt a difficult challenge. In such case, the outsourcing companies can install the Business Process Guidance (BPG) system. However, agents at times, may not have the proper knowledge on the particular problem and cannot get through the first call. Therefore, they need to have access to the real-time detailed knowledge, hidden in the existing system.</p>
<p><i>What is your FCR percentage?</i></p>
<p>Is it 60%?</p>
<p><i>What does that denotes?</i></p>
<p>Well, that is the benchmark, which you can use to measure the future increments. It also denotes that only 60% of the customer has received solution through the first contact and 40% of the customers get their problem solved at the second or the third call. According to the study done by the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ascentgroup/achieving-first-call-resolution-2010" target="_blank">Ascent Group</a>, KPI ranges from 30% to 98%. In such a perspective, 60% may not be detrimental.</p>
<p>It is time to do something and implement the right process to get significant data and bring changes. At Fusion, we make it work by gaining initial baseline management and thus increase the call center performance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being an <a class="zem_slink" title="Entrepreneur" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">entrepreneur</a>, what do you think as the most essential part of your business &#8211; Customers? Yes, the customers are our main priority. We have to keep them satisfied and happy so that they not only become our potential buyer but also a loyal friend.</p>
<p>In the last few months of 2012, we found that <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/call-center-outsourcing-become-more-efficient.html">evolving call center technology</a> is expanding customer base faster than the other years. The call centers worked up on different goals, hired the right people, motivated their staffs and understood the right metrics. With all these implementation customers has really turned out to be the winner.</p>
<p>However, there are some instances in which call centers still lags. Customers have their own set of expectation, which contact center managers often fail to achieve. If the managers take care of those aspects, then they are surely going to turn their business into the next <a class="zem_slink" title="Fortune 500" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Fortune 500 companies</a>.</p>
<p>As a leader in the contact center industry, Fusion BPO Services knows that customers are the lifeline of business. They are at the top of the priority list, and we consider the implementation of the best practices for our call center success.</p>
<p>According to the benchmark research report by<a href="http://www.foreseeresults.com/news-events/press-releases/consumers-love-hate-relationship-with-contact-centers-2012-foresee.shtml"> ForeSee demonstrates</a>, customer satisfaction has a large impact on the call center success. Based on the report, a model was prepared. Have a look:</p>
<p>Above result shows that satisfied customers are surely going to engage, interact, purchase and refer. Therefore, it clearly states that if we meet and exceed the customer expectations then we are going to be successful.</p>
<p>According to the report, three things, which a customer expects from a contact center, are:</p>
<h3>1) Best Platform to Share Information</h3>
<p>The customer turns frustrated when information recorded over the IVR is lost when the call gets transferred to the agents. So, do not allow the IVR or the CTI to become a hinder in your success path. Gather all call information prior to place a call and ‘whisper’ it to the agent. This allows your employees to spend more time providing customer service and less time in collecting the data.</p>
<h3>2) Enhanced IVR Experience</h3>
<p>If you are sending the callers on a wild goose chase, and ask them to navigate through the complicated phone menu, then you are sure to earn irate customers as returns. Many times, callers will zero-out in the hope of a quicker response, which leads to high costs as call get misdirected constantly. Visual IVR is a better option to replace the traditional phone menu, which has a visual interface on the web or mobile device.</p>
<h3>3) Eliminating Call Holding Time</h3>
<p>In our previous blog, we have discussed that call center benefits a lot by <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/can-contact-centers-eliminate-call-holding-time.html">eliminating call holding time</a>. Callers are of the opinion that they feel disrespected when they have to wait long in the call queue. Offer customers with scheduled callback option and let the callers choose a time that works best for them. The call centers need to connect the customers with the right agent every time regardless of where the calls come from – Web or Smartphone.</p>
<p>These three tips are just simple and inexpensive ways to stick to your potential customers and live up to their expectations.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we believe that our customers have other important things to do, rather than listening to the hold music. So we do not make our customer feel cringe when they think to call our contact center.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Going by the statistics, among 25 job holders in America, one is within the contact center industry. &#8211; Isn’t it a little thought provoking?</p>
<p>What do you think is in store of the contact center future? What do you think will happen to the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/what-it-takes-to-become-a-next-gen-contact-centers.html">outsourcing industry in 2013</a>? What are the changes they are going to experience this year and in near future?</p>
<p>Well, <em>Fusion</em> is a leader in the contact center services shares their list of compelling statistics, which are going to shape the outlook of the outsourcing world in 2013 and coming years.</p>
<p>Check out the 13 compelling statistics to shape the future of outsourcing &#8211;</p>
<h3>Self-Service and Call Automation Process<b><br />
</b></h3>
<ol>
<li>Number of customers who prefer automated Self-Service has doubled to 55% in the last five years.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/importance-of-ivr-technology-in-call-centers.html">IVR system</a> accounts for one-third of the total call experience. However, presently only 7% of them offer a better experience than live agents.</li>
</ol>
<p>Self-service keeps on growing every minute and changes the customer preference. Customers expect immediate service and satisfaction. Customers in the recent years expect instant gratification when it comes to customer service. They are savvy with the tools and provide immediate communication. They are not going to stay on hold. In 2013, you have to live up to their expectations. Employ artificial intelligence to make the self-service smarter and faster!</p>
<h3>Customer Service</h3>
<ol start="3">
<li>In this negative economy, customer experience is the highest priority and among customers, 60% is ready to pay for a better experience.</li>
<li>86% of the customers quit the business for a bad customer experience, 89% shifts to the competitor for a poor customer service, 59% tries a new brand for a better experience.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/customer-experience.jpg" alt="Customer Experience Impact" width="600" height="328" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4800" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/customer-experience.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/customer-experience-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Three things that you need to improve the outsourcing outlook in 2013 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross selling and up selling – (by 32 %)</li>
<li>Customer satisfaction – (by 33 %)</li>
<li>Customer retention – (by 42 %)</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot ignore the customer service and its aspects and if you neglect the quality of your customer service, then you will lose all the key consumers to your competitors. We at <em>Fusion</em> know our key customers who are ready to pay for better service and superior experience. So, we serve them in the best possible way.</p>
<h3>Quality and Performance Assessment<b><br />
</b></h3>
<ol start="5">
<li>According to the Forester Research, 31% of the organizations closely monitor the interactions with their target customers.</li>
<li>According to the A <a href="http://www.saddletreeresearch.com" target="_blank">Saddletree Research</a> Paper, done in 2012, 92% of the contact center leaders see high value in the sharing metrics that too in real time with the front-line agents.</li>
<li>Only 31% of the organization, according to the <a href="http://www.forrester.com/The+Customer+Experience+Index+2010/fulltext/-/E-RES55833?docid=55833" target="_blank">Forester Research</a> gets rewarded for their services across different companies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Top 5 five metrics shared in real time, can fetch high values include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Calls in Queue</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Customer Satisfaction</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>First Contact Resolution</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Service Level</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Schedule Adherence</i></b> (Not given in order)</li>
</ul>
<p>These stats show<b> </b>how companies need to pay more attention to agent quality and performance management in 2013, to maximize the potential of their employee. During this year, we need to employ the agents with real-time performance metrics and information. Most of the contact centers in 2012 failed to maintain their quality due to less customer insight from multiple siloed systems and applications to share the data.</p>
<p>The deployment of real time performance management software in 2013 will let you consolidate metrics from multiple contact centers and business applications. Another solution is the workflow automation and embedded analytics with QA solutions to help the customers and increase the revenues.</p>
<h3>Multi-Channel Networks</h3>
<ol start="8">
<li>Other than the phone, we have other service like to chat, use web self-service that accounts around 30% of the customer service engagements. 25% of the customers seek the help of one or two channels and 52% uses three to four channels.</li>
<li>In the United States 21% of the online shoppers like to have a live chat and 23% uses their phone and most of the crowd prefers to engage though emails, say around 54%. (This statistic is affirmed by the Bold Chat Group)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2013, the contact centers are going to use many channels to reach out to their customers. As they have to give 24-hour support, so they may consider any channel of communication. Example, number of business and contact centers are implementing live chat to meet the rising demand.</p>
<h3>Social Media</h3>
<ol start="10">
<li>50% of Facebook users and 80% of Twitter users expect to get a response to their customer service inquiry within a day. Failure to respond to the social media channels can increase the churn rate by 15%. <b></b></li>
<li>Customers since 2009 have been interacting over the social media channels. They are able to receive follow-up from the company, with 20% better and smarter contact center experience.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/social-customer-services-personalize-customer-support.html">Social media boost customer satisfaction</a>. Therefore, the contact centers have to be fast and must interact with the customer immediately or share their positive experience just with a click of a button.</p>
<h3>Cloud</h3>
<ol start="12">
<li>According to the <a href="http://www.dmgconsult.com/services/hostedCC/abstract.asp" target="_blank">DMG Consulting</a>, by 2015, 18% of the contact centers are going to <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/call-center-outsourcing-become-more-efficient.html">deliver cloud based contact center solutions</a>.</li>
<li>Around 57% of the users feel that the use of cloud computing has increased their security, if we compare the traditional methods for computing against the data backup.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of the contact centers by 2013 are going to change their call center environment with the use of cloud and finally contribute to the escalation of various processes.</p>
<p>These statistics are not only going to prove the changing outlook of outsourcing in 2013, but also show what transformations a contact center must achieve to make themselves proactive. Call center armed with right solutions is going to reap bigger productivity in future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, call center trend won’t die. Customers will keep on calling or receiving the phone, as it is the great media of contact.</p>
<p>There are so many reasons for the consumers to contact the companies and there is no reason to think that phone is dead. Consumers in this era prefer to get the support over the phone to another method of contacts. For this reason, the contact centers will, not die away any time soon.</p>
<p>Let us check out the latest survey that shows phone support is the most effective one:</p>
<p>The question asked in the survey was: <b><i>Which Method Do You Prefer To Contact with the Customer Service Call Centers?</i></b></p>
<table style="border:solid 2px #4BACC6; width:600px; text-align:center" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center">

</table>
<p>If you watch the chart carefully, you will find that telephonic conversation is still in huge demand over other new media. Even in United States, people prefer to converse over the online phone beside the telephonic conversation for their business transactions.</p>
<p>We at <em>Fusion</em> provide excellent customer support over the telephone, to maintain the top-notch client-customer relationship. A top-notch client-customer relationship is the hidden reason for successful business. Therefore, you must have it.</p>
<p>Fusion is a multichannel contact center, but phone support is the most effective if we compare to other channels. We have assessed that 72% of our customers are satisfied with the telephonic interaction. That too the service provided by the agents and the 12% of them are satisfied with self-service phone.</p>
<p>With the advancement in the technology, the call center structure has changed at a larger scale. Traditional call centers have to maintain plenty of staff on-hand to handle the incoming calls for customer service issues and queries.</p>
<p>The deployment of advanced call center technologies has made different business gain impetus in their niche. Presently 3.5 million of agents are working with US call centers. If we look into the number of inbound calls transacted over the year on average, it sums up to 45.4 billion and it costs $5.90 per calls.</p>
<h3>Futuristic Call Center at a Glance</h3>
<p>The number of agents working at today’s call center is huge. However, the concentration of the female population is little larger than the male population. Around 71% of the agents are female and 29% are male. As females are excellent at retaining tonal quality, along with the hospitality, which is essential for customer service.</p>
<p>Inbound calls are still having a large percentage in the call center queue. It is around 79% and the outbound calls are around 21%.</p>
<p>The number of customers served through the inbound and outbound calls is divided in two approaches: mass market and business customers. The percentage of mass-market customer is 75% and the business customers served are 25%.</p>
<p>The call center services are generally of three types: <em>customer service</em>, <em>sales only</em> and <em>sales plus</em> service. With the advent of higher technologies, the percentage of each service is categorized in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Providing customer service- 49%</i></li>
<li><i>Providing sales only- 21%             </i></li>
<li><i>Providing sale and service- 30%</i></li>
</ul>
<p>To stay ahead in this competitive market, get the right outsourcing partner. As call center won’t die but their efficiency will be in turn increasing at a rapid speed.</p>
