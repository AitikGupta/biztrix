								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can a call center stand out as a leader? Delivering excellent customer experience is one way of achieving the goal. The exceptional experience leads to a greater number of satisfied customers, and creates a loyal customer base that not only continues to purchase the product or service of a company but also recommends others to do the same.</p>
<p>Callers today use channels – phone, web or mobile applications to communicate with the company. Using multiple channels to get customer service is the latest trend in customer service industry and is referred to as multi-channel customer service.</p>
<p>Multi-channel customer service is not just about multiple support options. It is also about delivering the exceptional service through a channel, which the customers find suitable. Although multi-channel supports are in higher demand today, talking to a live agent still remains the most preferred way of customer interaction. However, in order to talk to a live agent, customers using different channels face some issues.</p>
<p>Do you know how long the customers are waiting in the queue before their questions are addressed? The longer they wait the lower drops their tolerance level. This makes them frustrated. So, reducing or eliminating the time of waiting in the queue (also known as hold time) is one important aspect of customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Now how will you eliminate the call holding time? – Here you will find the three highly preferred ways through which you can eliminate the hold time.</p>
<h2>How to Eliminate the Call Holding Time?</h2>
<p>In order to minimize the hold time, most of the contact centers offer better self-service options or attempt to reduce the call handling time. People, it is time to think outside the box. At Fusion, we prefer to do that. Check out the ways that can reduce the hassles of customers using different communication channels.</p>
<h3>1.  For Customers Who Use Phone</h3>
<p>A phone is one of the most preferred channels to resolve issues quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, during peak hours, all customer service executives remain busy on calls. As a result, many customers have to wait to talk to the personnel. This often leads to making customers unhappy. To eliminate the problem, organizations should offer a callback option instead of keeping the callers waiting.</p>
<h3>2.  For Customers Who Use Website</h3>
<p>Do you know what happens when the customers contact you via websites? Most of the sites only list a phone number and an email address – this is not the most convenient method to interact with customers. Why don’t you offer the same callback option through your website? It is the best solution that one can implement and leave a positive impression on the visitors. Fusion has incorporated request a callback option in their website. This has helped them streamline the calls and handle each issue effectively.</p>
<h3>3. For Customers Who Use Mobile</h3>
<p>If you look at a recent survey, you will find that mobile app downloads (total) rose by 171% from 6.1 billion to 16.5 billion between 2010 and 2011. (<a href="http://ovum.com/press_releases/mobile-phone-application-downloads-to-grow-144-this-year/" target="_blank">Resource</a>: Mobile Application Download and Revenue Forecast: 2011–16)</p>
<p>When customers click on the “Contact Us” page within the mobile app, what will they see? – A phone number? The customers do not prefer that. Do not send customers to the <a class="zem_slink" title="Interactive voice response" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_voice_response" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">IVR</a>.  Allow them to put in their number and request a callback. If you want put yourself ahead of your competitors, then have a click-to-call option. Remember, your customers are using the technology for a long time.  If you cannot keep up with that, they will go somewhere else.</p>
<p>The Callback is one such approach that allows you to give better service to your clients on their preferred channels. They provide the same caller experience regardless of the fact how they choose to contact you.</p>
