<p>The success of your debt collection efforts often depends on the effectiveness of your phone work. While following <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/are-there-laws-that-limit-what-debt-collectors-can-say-or-do-en-329/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</a> is an essential part of any debt collection process, the tone, timing, and framing of the conversation of the collection executive can make or break the call.</p>



<p>Having decades of experience in handling debt collection
calls on behalf of our clients, Fusion has in-depth knowledge on how to improve
your debt collection calls.&nbsp; Here we
share a few tips that can help you improve your debt collection efforts: </p>



<h2>Tips for Improving Debt Collection Calls</h2>



<h3><strong>Things to Remember:</strong></h3>



<p>While making <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/collection-services.html">debt collection calls</a> one must follow the letter of the law stating the best practices for A/R recovery. Apart from the legal ramifications, you must also keep in mind debt collection calls are made on behalf of your business and therefore, you should maintain the professional courtesy on the call. Remember, in this age of social media, one step out of the line can make your brand viral for all the wrong reasons. </p>



<p>Therefore, you must stay positive yet in-control of your
debt collection calls. A confident tone will earn you a better response from
your customers and help you meet the needs of your business without damaging
the company-customer relationship. </p>



<p>So how to prepare for success while making debt collection
calls? Here are some tried and tested tips:<strong>
&#8211; </strong></p>



<h3>1.    Be Proactive </h3>



<p>following up after sending the product or providing service
or one or two days prior to the due date may help you avoid non-payment.
Therefore, you must proactively interact with your customers and ask them if
everything was satisfactory and whether they have received the invoice.&nbsp; This will also help you maintain a better
customer-company relationship.</p>



<h3>2.    Be Prepared </h3>



<p>Before making the call gather and have in front of you as
much information about your customer and the debt as you can, including having
the file and all the invoices at hand. Fusion always advocates having all the
data at the agent’s fingertip.&nbsp; It helps
them improve the success rate of their collection calls.</p>



<h3>3.    Get Your Conversation Pointers Ready </h3>



<p>Before making a collection call, you must jot down the
pointers you want to talk about in a call.&nbsp;
This will help you stay in control over the conversation and get back on
track in case the interaction goes off the track. </p>



<h3>4.    Smile During the Call<strong> </strong></h3>



<p>While the customer can’t see your face, smiling can lighten
your tone of voice. This way, you will sound more positive and confident.&nbsp; Fusion has always encouraged its collection
agents to smile on call.&nbsp; It brings a
positive impact on the call.&nbsp; </p>



<h3>5.    Use the Person’s Name</h3>



<p>A person’s name is the sweetest thing to his ears and
addressing by their name adds the personal touch to the call creating a better
customer experience.&nbsp; However, overdoing
it will make the customer feel irritated.</p>



<h3>6.    Speak Confidently and Concisely</h3>



<p>Conveying a concise message in a confident tone can help you get a better response from your customers. However, you must never get emotional on collection calls or you will lose the control and the other party will take advantage of it.  If you feel emotional, you should wait for a while before answering. </p>



<p>Sure, it is difficult to keep emotions at bay especially while dealing with tricky customers. But a tricky customer can use your emotion against you. For this reason, it is always better to outsource your debt collection service to an experienced debt collection agency.  </p>



<h3>7.    Listen Carefully but also use Silence to Control the Conversation</h3>



<p>You need to be a good listener on a debt collection call.
Once you deliver your message in a concise way, you should listen to what the
other party has to say in this matter.&nbsp;
However, do not let the other party take control of the call. You can
use silence to take control back as and when necessary.</p>



<h3>8.    Stay Calm, Even if the Customer Gets Upset</h3>



<p>Not all collection calls go smoothly. During some calls,
emotions run high and the customer gets upset.&nbsp;
However, you must stay calm in such situations.&nbsp; If you too get emotional, the purpose of the
call will be ruined and you will have to start afresh. </p>



<h3>9.    Take Notes </h3>



<p>Documenting everything that is said, including the
customer&#8217;s feedback, can help you in case of any dispute. </p>



<h3>10.    Don&#8217;t Jump to Conclusions<strong> </strong></h3>



<p>The initial collection call should aim to confirm that the
debt has not been paid. This will ensure you are not alienating an otherwise
good customer. The unpaid invoice may be a miscommunication, and not a
collection issue at all, so you want to be careful. During our vast experience
in providing debt collection services, we have seen that a mistake from the
accounts department can lead to such problems. </p>



<h3><strong>11</strong>.    Give Options</h3>



<p>Suggesting options like paying in installments can help the
debtor clear their dues faster. If the person you are calling agrees to pay by
credit card, you must ensure that he/she signs the statement. You can fax them
the authorization form and have them fax it back after signing. Do not leave
anything to chances.</p>



<h3>12.    Get a Commitment</h3>



<p>Without a commitment from a customer to pay, the call is
potentially wasted. Whether it’s a partial or full payment, or a commitment to
pay at a certain date is essential for a successful collection call.</p>



<h3>13.    Conclude Well</h3>



<p>Before ending the call, you must convey the summary of the
entire call to the debtor party, including how and when they will make the payment
and depending on the mode of payment ask the debtor to confirm when the payment
has been made.</p>



<h3>14.    Keep in Interaction Open</h3>



<p>Someone who may not be able to pay up may be able to pay
later, so keep the conversation open. You can also help them figure out how to
get the money without paying big interest. This way you can carry on your
negotiation and still can maintain a good relationship with your customer. </p>



<p>These are some of the tips that can help you make professional quality debt recovery calls. Having problems handling collection calls on your own? Fusion can help.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every business faces the issue with accounts receivable every once in a while irrespective their size.  And yet, most of them feel as though it will affect the customer relationship negatively if they ask for or demand payment from the customer for the products/services provided.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this popular belief is not at all true.</p>
<p>Your customers will not get disappointed or leave your company just because you asked for payment for products/services provided. They know that they owe you. If your customers are leaving you, it’s not because you’re asking them to pay their bills, but it may have something to do with the way you go about collecting invoices.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, better accounts receivable management can considerably improve customer satisfaction and retention.</p>
<p>By implementing <a href="http://www.ofm.wa.gov/resources/misc/Receivable_Collection_Best_Practices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">debt collection best practices</a>, you can not only provide better customer service and increase customer satisfaction, but also you can increase your cash flow and grow your business.</p>
<p>Even if you have a few difficult customers who don’t want to pay, a majority of your customers truly do want to pay outstanding account receivable.  However, sometimes things do not go as planned and they fail to pay you on time.</p>
<h3>Why do you want to improve account receivable management?</h3>
<p>After all the time, effort and money it took to turn a prospect into a customer, you would not want to lose them over an unpaid invoice, right? You and your team have already given so much effort to retain these customers. Blowing the chance of repeat purchases because of a frustrating collection experience is not a wise decision. Also it takes a huge cost to acquiring a new customer.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is better to improve the collection experience by managing accounts receivable better and keep the existing customers happier.</p>
<h3>How can improved accounts receivable management make customers happier?</h3>
<p>It’s quite simple actually! <a href="http://www.vitalsolutions.net/" target="_blank">Good accounts receivable management</a> will make their lives much easier, help them remember to send in their checks, and make the process easy.</p>
<p>Here are a few simple things you can begin with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a plan. The Credit Research Foundation estimates that <a href="http://e2banytime.com/docs/White_Paper_-_How_To_Develop_A_Business_Credit_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">only 20% of credit departments have formalized policies with well-defined goals</a>.</li>
<li>Centralize all data and information</li>
<li>Provide agents with timely and accurate information to avoid any misunderstanding</li>
<li>Define roles. It is important to know who has which responsibility</li>
<li>Determine KPIs to see how your business is doing in overall collection scenario.</li>
<li>Manage your resources</li>
<li>Define dispute resolution procedure</li>
<li>Focus on important accounts</li>
<li>Be proactive and invoice the parties earlier to let them know it is time for them to pay their dues</li>
<li>Make sure invoices are complete and correct</li>
<li>Include your terms clearly on invoice</li>
<li>Have a standard system for follow-up (letters, emails, phone calls, etc.)</li>
<li>Escalate troubled accounts</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, if you have a small AR department or do not have the right tools for the job, you will find AR management a little difficult. After all, software and communication templates may save the situation but they will never be able to replace a personalized communication. In such case, to deal with accounts receivable, you might have to hire debt collection agencies that can deal with the situation expertly and make your customers happier.</p>
<p>Remember, accounts receivable is your last communication with the customer on a sale, and it can have a huge impact on whether or not they choose to do business with you again.</p>
