								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Great customer service is the need of the hour. If as an
organization you cannot provide good customer service you are sure to lose
their loyalty at some point in time. Therefore, you need to provide the best
possible service to your customer.</p>



<p>While every business today tries to <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html">provide excellent customer service</a> and reduce the customer effort with timely and effective support to improve their experience, it fails to recognize the most important aspect of delivering a customer experience – their employees who serve in a customer facing role. </p>



<p>If you make it difficult or the employees to do their job,
it will translate to the experience they deliver to your customers.&nbsp; Even if the difficult task is not directly
related to the customer, the frustration of doing that task somehow impacts the
employee-customer interaction. Also, it gradually makes your employees <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/reasons-and-remedies-of-employee-disengagement.html">disengaged</a>
resulting in an even poorer customer experience. Yet according to a CCW 2019 <a href="https://www.customercontactweekdigital.com/content-auto-download/5be9b822d1d92e406f3b64d1">study</a>,
most companies do not pay as much attention to reducing employee effort as they
do to personalization. </p>



<p>At Fusion, we give our employees utmost importance and
recognize their unique position in delivering a good customer experience. Therefore,
we always ask ourselves the following questions:</p>



<ul><li>What&#8217;s keeping employees from delivering the
great experience that your customers deserve?</li><li>Is there a way to simplify workflows and
processes?</li><li>How can we make it easier for employees to do their
job?</li><li>How do we make it easier for agents to deliver a
great customer experience by removing complexities, complications, and
bureaucracy?</li><li>Are there ways to reduce effort for employees
and ultimately, for customers?</li></ul>



<p>With our vast experience in the customer service industry,
we have found that making necessary changes to reduce the efforts of your employees
leads to improved customer experience. Here are a few suggestions on how to
turn things around for our employees, and eventually, for the customer.</p>



<h3>1. Walk In Your Employees&#8217; Shoes</h3>



<p>Walking in your employees’ shoes in the best way to
understand the effort they put every day. To do this, you can create any of the
two following things: </p>



<ol><li>Employee journey maps</li><li>Your own undercover executive program, in which executives take on the role of the employee. </li></ol>



<p>Once you understand the effort, you&#8217;ll be able to unearth
the inefficiencies and ready to improve the process. At Fusion, we have used
undercover executive program to see whether the employees are finding it easy
to do their job.</p>



<h3>2. Pay Attention To What Your Employees Are Saying</h3>



<p>Listen to what your employees are telling you. Watch them
work. If they say a process is difficult or pointless, you need to look into it
and fix it the best way you can. Ignoring it is not a wise decision.</p>



<h3>3. Ensure Employees Have The Right Tools</h3>



<p>When you define employee roles and expectations, make sure
that your employees have the knowledge, skills, training, and resources
required to do the job. &nbsp;Without the
right tool, training and knowledge they will not be able to provide prompt and
to-the-point solution to your customers, resulting in a poor customer
experience. </p>



<h3>4. Reduce Their Effort With Modern Technology </h3>



<p>At Fusion, we believe in providing our employees with the
most modern tools that make their jobs easier and less time consuming. For
example – if customer service agents get <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/automation-solutions.html">AI
assistance</a> that brings all the data related to a customer on a single
dashboard, it helps them serve the customer better. Having an <a href="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/benefits-of-adopting-omnichannel-customer-support.html">omnichannel</a>
environment makes it easier for the agents to ask suggestions of other agents
without putting the customer on hold and thus it reduces the agent effort and
ultimately the customer effort as well.</p>



<h3>5. Define The Idea Of A Great Customer Experience </h3>



<p>Giving your employees a clear idea about your customers will
help them understand what needs to be done. Defining the idea of a great
customer experience to them will give them a clear target and help them
understand how to get there. </p>



<h3>6. Provide Ongoing Feedback</h3>



<p>Giving your employees regular feedback and ongoing coaching provides
them with the guidance they need to follow the right path, to do things in a
better manner and to do it right every single time. Just like employee feedback
helps create a better process, giving regular feedback and training to the
employees help them deliver a better customer experience. According to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/11-employee-feedback-statistics">Hubspot</a>,
regular employee feedback can greatly impact employee engagement.</p>



<p>These are some useful tips that can help you reduce agent effort, root out the inefficiencies, and create a streamlined and simpler work process that makes the job easier for the employees. A simpler work process with the right tools and technology result in a better customer service while regular feedback and timely training boosts employee engagement. As a result, your employees are happy and your customers are happier.</p>



<p>Fusion has always been an advocate of reducing employee efforts and engaging them with timely feedback and training. We feel that when our agents are engaged, they provide a far more efficient customer support that boosts customer satisfaction. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BPO industry today is one of the most prominent industries in India, providing millions of jobs. However, it is also an industry with high attrition levels.</p>
<p>And to keep the attrition in check a number of BPO players are making considerable investments in resources and employee welfare services. The companies are also embracing several employee-friendly policies, such as innovative pay structure and job enrichment.</p>
<p>Being one of the top players in the BPO industry, Fusion too has faced issues with high attrition rates.</p>
<p>In order to cope with the problem, Fusion has made some changes to its policies to make it more employee-friendly. As a result they experienced a steep decline in the attrition rates.</p>
<p>So, what benefits did Fusion offer to its employees? Fusion says it is an eclectic mix of Job enrichment / enhancements, training programs and innovative pay structures –</p>
<p>Employee Benefits offered by Fusion:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Medi-claim Insurance Scheme:</strong> This insurance scheme is to provide insurance coverage to employees and their dependent family members (spouse, non-earning parents and children above three months). At Fusion employees are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151687731577873.1073741830.184998332872&amp;type=3" target="_blank">entitled to ESI</a> (Employee State Insurance).</li>
<li><strong>Subsidized Food and Transportation:</strong> The organizations provide transportation facility to all the employees from home till office at subsidized rates. The lunch provided is subsidized. At Fusion, we provide our employees with pick-up and drop facility and a lunch allowance.</li>
<li><strong>Company Leased Accommodation:</strong> Some of the companies provides shared accommodation for all the out station employees.  The purpose is to provide to the employees to lead a more comfortable work life balance. At Fusion we have a guest house for our outstation employees.</li>
<li><strong>Recreation, Cafeteria, and Concierge facilities:</strong> At Fusion, our HR team conducts different recreational activities like – singing competition, puzzle solving, poster drawing competition, from time to time.  Apart from that we have a 24-hour cafeteria and concierge facility.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Cellular Phone / Laptop:</strong> Cellular phone and / or Laptop are provided to the employees on the basis of business need. Whereas, the employee is responsible for the maintenance and safeguarding of the asset. At Fusion, we provide eligible employees with laptop/cell phone facility. Safekeeping of the same is the responsibility of the employee.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Health Care (Regular medical check-ups):</strong> Some of the BPOs provide the facility for general health check-up. For employees with above 40 years of age, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151259134637873.526086.184998332872&amp;type=3" target="_blank">medical check-up</a> can be done once a year. At Fusion we offer health camps at our office premises every year.</li>
<li><strong>Skill development:</strong> Fusion always encourages its employees to learn and develop new skills.  For this reason, the company often arrange for skill development training and personality development training.</li>
<li><strong>Performance based incentives:</strong> Many BPO companies today have plans for, performance based incentive scheme. Process performance i.e. speeds; accuracy and productivity of each process are considered to b the parameters for calculation. At Fusion we too have performance based incentives to all our employees.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Get together and other cultural programs:</strong> The BPO companies organize cultural programs as and when possible. Through this program the companies provide its employees with the opportunity to showcase their talents in singing, acting, drawing etc.  At Fusion too we organize competitions, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151616239737873.1073741826.184998332872&amp;type=3" target="_blank">rangoli making</a>, poster drawing and many other events. We also like to celebrate festivities with our employees. We also conduct various intra-office sports programs such as Cricket, football, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Referral Scheme:</strong> Several companies implement employee referral scheme to encourage employees to refer friends and relatives for employment in the company.  At Fusion too we have a similar kind of referral scheme for our employees.</li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from these benefits, Fusion also takes care of the well-being of its employees. That’s the reason they shifted most of their non-voice processes to day shift so that a large section of their employees can work in the morning shift.</p>
<p>Those who work on night shifts also get rotational shifts so that they too do not have to work in the wee hours at night. Working against the biological clock may often lead to health issues. Fusion does not want its employees, who are the true assets of the company.</p>
<p>Fusion believes in the motto that if you are truly interested in your employees, they too stay interested in you. We make an effort to retain talent and our hard work often pays off.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Employees are the structural unit of a company and to get the maximum output from them, a company must take care of their happiness and well-being.</p>
<p><i>Do you think that the positive emotions influence the performance of your employees?</i></p>
<p><i>Are you optimistic to generate better results? </i></p>
<p>According to the research done by the positive psychology team, both the answers are “Yes”. The happiness of your employees is sure to influence their performance.</p>
<p><a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/martin-seligman-father-positive-psychology-3376382.html" target="_blank">Martin Seligman</a> and his team developed a branch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology" target="_blank">positive psychology</a> that studies the effect of the positive emotions and the development of the virtue of the people. The areas they include are &#8211; <i>happiness, creativity, optimism, humor, resilience and emotional intelligence.</i></p>
<p>We, at Fusion believe that the management of the contact center can be enriched by the use of this particular theory. The Positive Psychology team is of the opinion that when the job makes sense to the employees, it generates satisfaction and fulfillment. This is in contrast to the traditional working formula that linked to sacrifice by the employees. In contrary to this belief, studies also proved that positive psychology could be a great source of energy and comprehensiveness to maintain the continuity of “flow”.</p>
<p>Are you aware of the concept of “flow”? &#8211;  The concept of “flow “ was developed by the psychologist <a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi.html" target="_blank">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a>, who explained the state in which the person gets completely absorbed in a kind of activity for his or her own pleasure and enjoyment during time files and the action, thought, movements and succeeds without any pause.</p>
<p>He also argues that the person who is in “flow” is completely absorbed by the activity, during which they loses the track of time and experiences a great satisfaction indeed. Actually, the concept goes like this – if we enjoy the work we do, we experience this kind of feeling.</p>
<p align="center"><iframe src="http://embed.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<h3>How Contact Centers Apply This Concept In The Management?</h3>
<p>Many contact centers, even Fusion apply this concept to enhance their employee performance rate. Contact center can apply this concept through three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicating Clear Objectives</li>
<li>Immediate Feedbacks</li>
<li>Balancing the Individual Challenges to Skills</li>
</ul>
<h3>Communicating Clear Objectives</h3>
<p>The employees will perform well enough, if they are aware of the expectation that their boss and company have from him or her. The key factor stresses on the personalized communication, which is similar to the style of each contributor.</p>
<h3>Immediate Feedbacks</h3>
<p>Keep time in your hand to give good feedback to your team. The invocation is able to promote learning and encourages the positive agents. Providing feedback does not mean that you will pointing out the errors, rather you need to emphasize on what went right and what was not considered as an opportunity to learn something.</p>
<h3>Balancing the Individual Challenges to Skills</h3>
<p>When the objectives are stored at a long distance and if you think of implementing them, then be sure to meet with conflicts. Employees’ experiences frustration at every level, and feels discontent like their supervisors. Many times this frustration is caused due to the negative feedback. Therefore, the contact center management needs to maintain a balance between collaborative and operational needs. Dialogue and the feedbacks are the two meters to report on the balance sought.</p>
<p>Therefore, look for the three options to implement in your contact center management and boost up your employee happiness meter.</p>
