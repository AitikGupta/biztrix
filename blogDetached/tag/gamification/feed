								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gamification is a fun and growing way that can improve collection call center performance and agent engagement. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">Gamification</a> has been very effective in improving employee performance and business results at collections-focused contact centers. Benefits of gamification programs include increased revenues from higher recovery rates, improved compliance, making training more fun and effective, and improved employee retention.</p>



<p>Employee engagement is a persistent problem of
collection-based call centers. Due to unengaged employees, collection call
centers often face an issue like: </p>



<ul><li>Flat or declining recovery rates</li><li>High abandon rates</li><li>Increased customer service complaints</li><li>Increased compliance violations</li><li>High employee attrition rates</li></ul>



<p>However, by adding gamification to the mix, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/collection-services.html">collection call centers</a> can improve script adherence, raising recovery rates, improving compliance with disclosure requirements, and reducing the onboard time for new agents by making training more effective. This change in agent behavior also helps collection centers to improve customer satisfaction ratings.</p>



<p>Having a long experience in the collection industry, Fusion
has a step-by-step approach in designing a gamification strategy to engage its
collection agents.&nbsp; </p>



<ol><li>Define goals</li><li>Apply interaction analytics to identify baseline
performance and improvement opportunities</li><li>Define key performance indicators (KPIs) for the
program</li><li>Identify the appropriate motivators for agents</li></ol>



<p>With our experience in this field, we understand that
successful gamification is not game oriented but goal oriented. Rooted in clear
business goals quantifiable by appropriate metrics, successful gamification
needs to have the right motivators so that agents can easily get hooked. Some
important things to remember while designing a gamification program:</p>



<h3>1. Define Goals</h3>



<p>A gamification program without a defined business goal is
doomed to fail from the beginning. If you don’t know what you want to achieve
through the program, running the program has no point at all. Whether you want
to improve customer satisfaction by 5%, reduce 10% employee attrition, or
improve your recovery rates, you need to be clear about that even before
designing a gamification program.</p>



<h3>2. Define KPI</h3>



<p>Having the right metrics is the key. You cannot judge
customer satisfaction by looking at script adherence rate. To make a
gamification program successful, you need appropriate metrics that help you
measure your success in terms of your business goals. You can use analytics to
keep a track of how things are going and whether there is any scope for
improvement.</p>



<h3>3. Choose Motivators</h3>



<p>Choosing motivators can be a difficult task as not everyone
is motivated by the same thing. While baby boomers get motivated to earn points
and rewards, millennials get motivated by public recognition. Therefore, it can
be easily said that there is no one size fits all reward.&nbsp; While money can be a powerful reward, it is
not the only effective incentive. Incentives like paid time off, meals,
merchandise, company gear, recognition on the company’s social media page are a
few other incentives that work well.</p>



<h3>4. Set Time Limits</h3>



<p>A contest that goes on indefinitely will lose its effectiveness. Setting a certain start and end time helps businesses raise participation and effort while the contest is in effect. If a long-term program is needed to meet the business goal (<em>for example improving a 5 percent improvement in customer satisfaction ratings every year</em>), consider conducting a series of consecutive contests rather than one long one. </p>



<p>It is important to recognize the end of the program where
top performers will be recognized and participants will be updated about the result
and how the program helped meeting the business goal. You can also conclude the
program with a small party to get the feedback that can help you make future
engagements more effective. </p>



<h3>5. Inspire Continued Involvement</h3>



<p>Contests should have the mechanisms to motivate participants
to stay involved, even after meeting the performance required or when they have
almost zero chance of winning. You can encourage agents to continue working
towards goals as groups. That way, they will be able to achieve more than they
can achieve individually.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Fusion has seen that providing rewards for meeting
performance thresholds is a great way to promote continued involvement and keep
participants motivated. Reward thresholds can also be used in combination with
more competitive contests to get more effective results.</p>



<h3>6. Communicate</h3>



<p>To maximize the effectiveness of a gamification program you need consistent communication before, during, and after the contest. This will help organizations maximize agent participation in a program, improve buy-in by helping agents understand why a certain goal or metric is vital, explain rules clearly so that there is no confusion or hard feelings about unclear rules, and make motivation more effective by bringing good performers into the limelight. Fusion has always found communication to be the key to successful gamification programs in a collection call center. </p>



<p>These are some of the ways a collection call center can improve its employee engagement and customer experience through the call center. The key is to find a defined goal, time limit, performance indicators, and the right motivator, and measuring it all through application analytics. If you rightly engage your employees through gamification, your employees will be inspired to perform at optimum level even after the program ended, resulting in better customer experience as well. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Easter approaches, it’s now official that spring has sprung. The new financial year has begun. And it’s time for a fresh start.  So, the businesses need to come out of their hibernate mode and shake things up a bit.</p>
<p>Now that won’t be much of a difficulty for the businesses.  There are always some major areas that can welcome a few changes. For example, in BPOs, employee attrition is a pressing issue.  Every year thousands of BPO employees leave an organization to join another, and at the same time, switch careers.</p>
<p>So what is this reason behind such a high rate of attrition? Lack of engagement is one of the major reasons behind this. Believe it or not, a section of your employees are completely disengaged.  They neither share the company perspective nor bring something to the table to enhance the outlook.  They just clock in and clock out while not contributing substantially.</p>
<p>As a result, the entire operation of a BPO faces problems.  When these non-engaged employees commune with the customers, they are not able to build a strong bond. As a result, the optimum level customer satisfaction is not met.</p>
<p>Did you know that about half members of your workforce is probably not engaged?  According to a semi-annual Employment Engagement Index by <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/165269/worldwide-employees-engaged-work.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gallup Management Journal</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 13% of employees round the world are actively engaged in their jobs. They are passionate about their organization and help move the organization forward.</li>
<li>63% employees are not engaged and put no passion into their work. They remain active but accomplish nothing to benefit the company.</li>
<li>24% employees are actively disengaged and busy venting and showing their unhappiness, which in turn, undermines what their engaged co-workers are trying to accomplish.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a competitive world, customer satisfaction often has the final words in the purchase decision.  Therefore, it is very important. And to achieve the level of satisfaction, it is essential that each of the contact center employees is highly motivated and give their 100% to the job.</p>
<h2><strong>Gamify Your Employee Engagement Strategy</strong></h2>
<p>Now, the most important question remains – how to re-engage these employees? There are several ways.  But so far, applying gamification techniques to re-engage staff has worked wonders for most companies.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, what does an employee want most out of his job? Money? No. They want recognition, appreciation and rewards.  These are some great motivators that can surely engage employees.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="http://www.cognizant.com/InsightsWhitepapers/Gamifying-Business-to-Drive-Employee-Engagement-and-Performance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cognizant</a> rightly points out that gamification is as much needed in terms of employee engagement as it is needed  to increase customer engagement. Today, the SMAC stack or social, mobile, analytics and cloud technology has opened new opportunities for engaging customers through various channels.  A company can also use the similar channels to engage employees. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The Marriott Group <a href="http://news.marriott.com/2011/06/my-marriott-hotel-opens-its-doors-on-facebook.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">uses</a> My Marriott Hotel Facebook game for recruitment. Similar to FarmVille, the game requires job aspirants to manage the hotel’s kitchen operations, earning or losing points based on customer satisfaction. This way, the company can attract and recruit talented employees.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6108" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marriott-hotel-facebook-game.jpg" alt="Marriott Uses Social Media Gaming" width="595" height="450" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marriott-hotel-facebook-game.jpg 595w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marriott-hotel-facebook-game-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Target stores have implemented a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5421678/target-makes-cashiering-more-tolerable-by-turning-it-into-a-game" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">game</a> for their cashiers to play when checking people out. It shows the cashier that whether the item that was just scanned in the optimum time. Then they can see their score on screen and know whether they are using their time optimally.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6107" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/game-for-cashiers.jpg" alt="Target stores game for their cashiers" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/game-for-cashiers.jpg 500w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/game-for-cashiers-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Some organizations create interesting festivity games like the Easter egg hunt to keep the employees engaged and share the results of each level of the game on social media tagging the winners. This gives the employees a sense of belonging, which in turn help them reconnect with the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Fusion, we keep our agents engaged with regular feedback, interesting games and other fun activities and we feature our winners on our social media pages.</p>
<p><strong>For Easter, you can have some special gamification plans. Such as &#8211;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Revamping the game ‘<em>Steal the Egg</em>’ to suit the office environment. Every agent will have their own basket of eggs and when one makes an upsell, they will be free to steal one egg from another. At the end of the day, the one with the highest number of eggs will get a special prize.</li>
<li>You may also put a large egg basket with the amount of money written in the eggs. For each successful sales, agents will be allowed to take one egg and will be rewarded the money immediately.</li>
<li>You can also play the game while replacing the money with experience &#8211; ‘<em>Can go home 2 hour early</em>’, ‘<em>Gets a Domino’s gift voucher</em>’, ‘<em>Wins a free trip for two to an amusement park</em>’, ‘Gets to play the role of Team Leader for one day’ and so on. It is often said that the employees love experiences more than money. It’s time to test that faith.</li>
</ul>
<p>A survey by the <a href="http://www.aberdeen.com/_aberdeen/app/research-survey/library.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aberdeen Group</a> found that organizations who set up gamification improve engagement by 48% and turnover by 36%.  Therefore, this Easter, businesses should start fresh and gamify their processes to engage their employees, which in turn will bring them better turnover and heightened customer satisfaction.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a customer calls the contact center of a business and communicates with its agents, they should always have a pleasant customer experience. However, in many cases, the customers have an experience that is far from pleasant. More often than not, it is because of the disengaged agents who do not put their 100% in the job.</p>
<p>Yes, a lack of engagement is one of the biggest challenges businesses are facing nowadays. As a matter of fact, the U.S. economy loses $350 billion annually due to these disengaged employees. The loss is not only in terms of productivity, but it is also the main cause of employee attrition. Research shows that the engaged employees are <a href="http://www.bunchball.com/resources/its-no-game-gamification-transforming-call-center">87%</a> less likely to part ways with an organization than the disengaged.</p>
<p>So, the question remains – is there a magic solution that can elevate the customer experience, improve business operations and transform the disengaged employees into loyal brand advocates?</p>
<p>Um, yes. And it is known as gamification. When applied in the right context, it can yield multiple benefits to a business. The benefits include:</p>
<p><strong>It Allows Business to Collect Powerful Customer Data</strong> &#8211; Businesses can learn loads of new information about their customers using gamification techniques. This allows them to engage the customers in a personalized conversation and improves the customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>Gamification Can Also be a Good Learning Tool – </strong>Using the gamification creatively, a business can launch a new product or service in the market. Even the simple technique of introducing the customers who visit their site to the product and teaching them about its use via a game allows a business to earn new businesses.</p>
<p>However, business should have a clear idea about how much they want to offer to the prospects. Giving it all out for free is never a good business technique.</p>
<p><strong>Gamification Can Help Business Reengage their Employees</strong> &#8211; Taking the cue from gamification techniques; a business can also engage their employees to give their very best at work. Introducing titles like employee of the week/ month/ year, announcing reward points and prizes will keep the employees engaged.</p>
<p>In a contact center, that will mean more satisfied customers, more sales, and a stable workforce. Some major employee issues like loss of productivity and employee attrition can be avoided.</p>
<p>Take a look at these five amazing statistics on the use of gamification.</p>
<ol>
<li>According to Gartner, by 2016, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/user/registration/prospect?resId=2226015&amp;srcId=1-3132930191&amp;pcp=gi_sr_gam&amp;cm_sp=gi-_-free-_-heroleft" target="_blank">gamification will become an essential element</a> for businesses to improve customer marketing and loyalty.</li>
<li>By 2015, the gamification industry is estimated to grow to more than <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gabe-zichermann/gamification_b_2516376.html?ir=India" target="_blank">$2 billion</a> in the U.S. according to M2 Research.</li>
<li>According to <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2211115" target="_blank">Gartner</a>, over 40% of the top-notch companies will be using gamification to give their business operations a complete makeover by the end of 2015,</li>
<li>According to a report by <a href="https://www.custedge.com/gamification-get-your-contact-centre-game-on/" target="_blank">Aberdeen Research</a>, businesses that used gamification have experienced two times faster growth in their annual revenue than their peers.</li>
<li>In a research by <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/05/18/the-future-of-gamification/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a>, 53% of participants predicted that by the year 2020, gamification will spread far and wide among businesses, while 42% respondents have also predicted that, by 2020, gamification will not become a larger trend except in specific cases.</li>
