								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is often essential for hospitals and the medical practitioners to look for the best medical answering service. Not just to keep their customers satisfied with the happy retreat but to make them gain  confidence on the company and their products/services.</p>
<p>When you choose a contact center who offers you with <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">medical answering service</a>, you have to consider its every potential point, like – the price charged, CSR training, 24/7 support and testimonials from the previous clients.</p>
<p>However, if you want to secure the information of your customers and you are cautious about their exchange, then make sure that the answering service you choose is <a class="zem_slink" title="Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">HIPAA</a> Compliant. This is the topmost priority, which your contact center must possess to make their answering services totally confidential and safe for your customers or patients.</p>
<h3>HIPAA &#8211; What is it?</h3>
<p>Came into action by the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3103.ENR:" target="_blank">Congress in 1996</a>, HIPAA or the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act. It was established to protect every patient’s privacy and to make sure that the patients’ files never get shared with another party without the patient&#8217;s consent, preferably written consent. If your business deals with patients, then you have to activate the medical answering service and make sure that the contact center who disburses such service are HIPAA compliant.</p>
<h3>What Should You Look In A Medical Answering Service?</h3>
<p>You have to make sure that the answering service provider is in full compliance with HIPAA. Fusion and their customer representatives have completed the appropriate training to meet all kinds of regulations. Our agents attend regular training and workshops in order to stay on the top of any new <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/index.html" target="_blank">HIPAA regulations</a>. We also take care while training each CSR on how to deal with patients on the phone, when they discuss the information, which are extremely personal. CSRs have to be sensitive and reassure that the caller and his information remain secure in our hand.</p>
<p>You also have to check that the contact center and their staff are not just answering the phone call of the patients but helping patients with health information. Make sure that the contact centers give them the proper training. Check with the vendor that the data is stored, and they have a disaster security and recovery system to restrict the potential hackers or any kind of system failures.</p>
<p>We update out our answering service technology at Fusion, since being the leader in BPO services, we know regular updates can prevent the future errors.</p>
<h3>Security Measures</h3>
<p>An answering service must possess some other things so that they can ensure that the patient’s information and data are safe in their hand. Go through this following list to know what the leading contact center can offer you through the answering service. Make sure you choose a contact center who is HIPAA Compliant.</p>
<ol>
<li>Protected email portals</li>
<li>Having fax covers that include privacy statements</li>
<li>No visitors allowed in the secured areas</li>
<li>Secure systems installed to dispose medical data</li>
<li>System to hide the information to those who walk by</li>
</ol>
<p>Fusion implements all these rules at the contact center to give the real retreat to their customers, as well as their business clients.</p>
