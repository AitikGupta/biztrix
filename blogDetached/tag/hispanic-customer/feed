								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Hispanic community is one of the major ethnic groups in the United States. The Hispanic consumers account for over 15% of the total adult population in the US. In fact, Hispanic Millennials are far more active consumers than their older generations. They are  <a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/235057/hispanic-millennials-not-what-you-think.html">17% of the total millennial crowd</a>. Just like any other Millennials these Hispanic Millennials too are the right audience for mobile engagement and mobile advertising.</p>
<p>Studies also show that while the rate of cell phone ownership of a Hispanic and a non-Hispanic are likely to be the same, the Hispanics are far more likely to have a smartphone as their primary device to connect to the internet than a non-Hispanic one. As a result, the opportunity for customer engagement via mobile is far greater in the case of a Hispanic consumer than a non-Hispanic one.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.experian.com/blogs/marketing-forward/2014/05/19/hispanics-are-mobile-dominant-are-your-campaigns/">Experian Marketing Services</a>, 63% of Hispanic adults own a smartphone as compared to 60% of non-Hispanics. Earlier in 2012, the numbers were 52% and 51% respectively. Experian Marketing Services also reveal that 45% of Hispanic smartphone owners are mobile-dominant in the case of internet usage While only 38% of non-Hispanics. So, as a matter of fact, Hispanics smartphone owners are 17% more likely than non-Hispanics to access the Internet through their phone than through a computer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6200" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hispanics-are-mobile-dominant.png" alt="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/how-to-direct-customers-to-the-right-service-channel.html" width="614" height="459" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hispanics-are-mobile-dominant.png 614w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hispanics-are-mobile-dominant-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></p>
<p>The above statistics clearly show that in <a href="https://medium.com/@arifulanam/3-strategies-that-bring-brands-closer-to-latino-audience-848da0a3fab6" target="_blank">order to grab the Hispanic audience attention</a>, one needs to opt for mobile-friendly marketing and customer service. In other words, a mobile-first approach will be the most useful tool for businesses trying to woo the Hispanic customer. If a business can design their campaigns, emails, websites and ecommerce initiatives to effectively engage a customer on a mobile device, they are far more likely to win over their Hispanic audience.</p>
<p>According to Experian, 37% of Hispanic adults admit using cell phones while watching television; whereas only 29% non-Hispanics admit to doing so. The study also reveals that, 50% of Hispanic smartphone owners use their phone while watching TV compared with just 42% people of other ethnicities. In the usage or smartphone during TV time, Hispanic Millennials standing at 61% beat Millennials of other ethnicities by 3%.</p>
<p>So, it won’t be an exaggeration to say that traditional advertising mediums like TV will not be an effective choice in launching marketing campaigns targeting Hispanic audience. If a business wants to win them over using minimum effort, knowing what specific <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/120400990015825965/">mobile activities Hispanics are engaging</a> can aid the marketers decide on the best mobile engagement strategy that includes telemarketing, email marketing, social media marketing and engagement through chat.</p>
<p>Besides, businesses can also take a mobile first approach in case of customer service. It will aid them to reach their customers via their preferred medium of communication – emails, chat, call, social media and a lot more. The <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/how-to-direct-customers-to-the-right-service-channel.html" target="_blank">multichannel customer service approach</a> will surely work for the Hispanic consumers. A multilingual or Spanish multichannel call center can aid the businesses in their pursuit.</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever you target the Hispanic market that is known for their $1 trillion in purchasing power, think mobile-first. Whether it is a marketing campaign or customer service, a mobile first approach with both English and <a href="http://www.ocurrance.com/spanish-call-center.html?utm_source=Fusion&amp;utm_medium=fusionblog&amp;utm_campaign=FusionBlog" target="_blank">Spanish language customer support</a> will help you become successful in the Hispanic market</p>
