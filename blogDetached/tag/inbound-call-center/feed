								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="&quot;lightbox&quot;&quot;" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/profit.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4524" title="call center services" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/profit.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a>The call center industry started when the business enterprises felt the urgency to outsource their customer care services. Given the work load the business enterprises had to face suddenly on the eve of globalization it became pretty much impossible to handle the innumerable customer issues on their own.  But the customer care department cannot be neglected if the existing customers were to be retained and newer ones were to be roped in. This is the reason why <strong><a title="call center services" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/services.html">call center services</a></strong> assumed so much importance in conducting the business affairs better.</p>
<p>It is the incredible amount of success that these inbound call center companies have registered in customer care services that encouraged them to expand their scope of services. Now these companies even assist in marketing and advertising of the business products or services. And they are doing a good in fact a great job. Qualified lead generation has become so much easier after these specialized firms have taken up the responsibility on behalf of the business houses.</p>
<p>Not only expansion but these business houses have also specialized in various fields. For instance, answering service has for long been the forte of the call center companies. Handling business calls on behalf of the business was their primary responsibility. But the service based industries were reluctant to outsource. But now with the answering service staffs specializing in medical, legal, financial and other areas, the service based businesses can also reap the benefits of outsourcing.</p>
<p>Thus the expansion and the specialization of the call center services is a good news for the business enterprises indeed.</p>
