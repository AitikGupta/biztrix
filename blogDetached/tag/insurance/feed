								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The natural calamities like &#8211; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/27/chile-haiti-earthquake-co_n_479705.html" target="_blank">Haiti and Chile earthquakes</a>, floods in United States have taken a steady rise across the boundaries of the world since 2010. It has resulted the businesses to incur immense loss, and a large number of fatalities.</p>
<p>With the attack of the natural calamities, the settlement claims of the insurance firms and the spike in calls has increased excessively. The insurance company gets totally lost in the huge cloud of calls. Hence, they search an effective system to ensure that the claims are settled without any further delay. Not only claim settlement managing the irate customers, they need someone to entertain all the calls instead of abandoning  them.</p>
<p>It is some kind of risk of the financial loss that the insurance firms face at these situations along with their reputation loss.</p>
<p>What could be the most effective ways for the insurance companies to handle the grievance of the customers during natural calamities? – Choose an “Outsourcing” partner, in order to reduce the risk in company’s reputation.</p>
<p>You have both onshore and offshore outsourcing company. But offshore is more efficient since, during calamities the onshore BPO partners becomes unable to engage with customers so offshore outsourcing is more reliable and affordable. Apart from handling calls what does outsourcing do?</p>
<p>Do you know what does outsourcing actually mean? Check out the full form of <strong>O-U-T-S-O-U-R-C-I-N-G</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>O</b>&#8211; Optimal</li>
<li><b>U</b>&#8211; Unique</li>
<li><b>T</b>&#8211; Team effort</li>
<li><b>S</b>&#8211; Seamless service</li>
<li><b>O</b>&#8211; Organized</li>
<li><b>U</b>&#8211; Ubiquitous</li>
<li><b>R</b>&#8211; Relevant sales</li>
<li><b>C</b>&#8211; Competitive results</li>
<li><b>I</b>&#8211; Impromptu agents</li>
<li><b>N</b>&#8211; Notable</li>
<li><b>G</b>&#8211; Goal-achiever</li>
</ul>
<p>During the catastrophe BPO leaders like Fusion tends to provide unparalleled services like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce in the recruitment, hiring and training of agents</li>
<li>Increased focus on core competencies</li>
<li>Decrease in operating expenses</li>
<li>Utilizing modern technologies, expertise and skills in regard to claim processing</li>
<li>Enhanced customer satisfaction</li>
<li>Increase in revenue growth</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the companies do have their own <a class="zem_slink" title="Business continuity planning" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Business Continuity Plan</a> (BCP) in place, but they lack the catastrophe management program. They do not have the blueprint to handle the catastrophe. At Fusion, we provide our clients with an action plan, to handle the customer efficiently during calamities. We utilize our talent pool to manage the calls at insurance companies and minimize the problems of the end-customer.</p>
<p>We serve our client insurance companies not only by generating by generating quality leads, but during the financial loss, we help them with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-trained resources to manage the spike in calls</li>
<li>Additional hour of protection due to the catastrophe</li>
<li>Support the company with assistance staffs to manage the increased call traffic</li>
<li>Monitoring the incoming call pattern</li>
</ul>
<p>A catastrophe is the real test of an insurance company to see, how they can sustain an effective customer support despite a huge spike. It is essential for the organization to meet the challenges and hold back their reputation. So here an outsourcing partner comes to play a vital role.</p>
<p>Being the leader in the outsourcing industry, Fusion says that having an action plan is must. Insurance companies need to act, synchronize and achieve customer goals even in the catastrophe with reliable outsourcing solutions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the telemarketing business, we know that everyone tries to make a few calls and boost the business at one go. The phone is the ultimate source to gather, quality leads.</p>
<p>Outsourcing contact centers produces lead for the insurance agents or brokers through the advanced telemarketing tactics and <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/lead-generation.html">lead generation services.</a> At <em>Fusion</em>, our clients get exclusive leads so that they can stay in front of the clients closing business.</p>
<p>The only way to get better insurance leads is to employ the outsourced telemarketing services and sail on the same boat as the competitors. Check out how <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/telemarketing-services.html">outsource telemarketing companies</a> help the insurance agents gain powerful leads in 5 easy steps.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Agents Must Say – Why They Are Calling?</h3>
<p>In the first 20 seconds, most calls are either booked or lost. The agents are aware that they are interrupting the caller. Therefore, at the call center three rules for opening the calls are seriously followed:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Giving a self-introduction to the customer</i></li>
<li><i>Impressing them through a compelling statement</i></li>
<li><i>Ending with an open-ended question</i></li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 2: Avoid Talking At Length in the Opening</h3>
<p>At contact centers, the telemarketing agent simply engages the prospect in a conversation. On the common question of how or why, the customers ideally replies, that they are seeking the particular solution. However, agents never make a mistake to talk at lengths in the beginning of the call. An opening call of 7-minute length is surely going to turn a customer irate. Therefore, this rule is strictly followed by the telemarketing agents as a step ahead to gather quality leads.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Agents Should Never Say That They Are Selling a Product</h3>
<p>Yes, this is the most important approach that a telemarketing agent maintains. This aspect is another assured step to success. Agents know what they are going to sell. They generally sell an appointment and until they sold it, they won’t sell your product. At Fusion, we advice our agents not to make the mistake of going into deeper conversation until they <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/life-insurance-appointment-setting-service-quality-life-insurance-leads.html">make the appointment secured</a> for the clients. Once the customers agree to meet, our agent clarifies the address, phone, e-mail, etc. to ease the task for the insurance agents.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Qualifying the Appointment</h3>
<p>The agents make sure that they hit on something in which the customer feels interested. It is the time to find out whether it matches up the insurance agent’s requirement or not. Agents never beg for appointment or take an appointment where the decision makers are absent. They do not waste time with meetings that are not likely to turn into a sale.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Slowing Down, Listening Carefully and Reading Out the Script</h3>
<p>Agents make sure that they stay calm when they place the call for particular customers on behalf of the insurance agents. Next step is to turn in a good listener, as listening is the hot button to success. Agents in reputed contact centers takes notes on what customers are saying, why customer chose the competitors or why they are not able to meet.</p>
<p>Finally, the telemarketing agent sticks to a script while they handle a campaign. Fusion is counted among the reputed lead generation companies for US, which at every step make sure that the insurance agent gets exclusive leads for turning them into potential customers.</p>
<p><b><i>Hit it!</i></b> The contact centers make sure that they “<b><i>Sell the Appointments and Not Products</i></b><i>”</i> over the phone. Agents make sure that they close the appointment and the appointment only! This in turn makes the insurance agents and the broker succeed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life insurance is the most common form of investment in which every safe buyer likes to spend. Therefore, the advisors who leverage their lead generation services to insurance call centers looks for better and more quality leads.</p>
<p>This story may sound familiar to many of you. The advisors who work with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Life_insurance_companies" target="_blank">life insurance companies</a> as prominent agents are going independent. They call the outsourcing companies to purchase the leads from them. An independent advisor uses these leads to settle appointments per week. They meet with two to three people per week and try to close all of them.</p>
<p>However, the insurance lead bought from the outsourcing companies cannot fetch them good appointments, so they are making a thorough research while choosing the call center services. Every advisor complains about the quality of the leads, as this often leads to fallout from the appointments they set. Now they can actually leverage their appointment setting service at contact center to ease their task to the next level.</p>
<h3>How You Can Set Appointment With Quality Leads?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/appointment-setting.html">life insurance appointment setting service</a><b><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/appointment-setting.html">,</a> </b>nurture the lead with a positive outlook. The leads are easy to close. When advisors settle their appointments on their own, they face some restriction and objection, which they must avoid to smoothen their appointments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobody likes to meet a salesperson who is pushy, even when they know that they need the product and services the salesperson offers. Customers are afraid that they will be pushed into buying something that they may not need or they might be spending more money than they can afford.</li>
<li>Most prospects are of the opinion that life insurance policies are somewhat alike. To give them the perfect senses pick the less expensive one.</li>
</ul>
<p>One has to overcome these objections as a part of their natural selling process and an opportunity to help people see how valuable the service can be. To overcome this obstruction the advisors now choose the appointment setting services to hatch the lead in perfect order.</p>
<h3>How Advisors Can Overcome The Objections To Their Appointments?</h3>
<p>Jot down the common objection that you hear over the phone and in person. Then think about the questions asked and prepare an answer that you should provide the lead to overcome the objection in near future. Practice these questions and responses until you learn them by heart. This allows you to have a better chance of setting the appointment.</p>
<p>When you are aware of what you want to say, then you can set the appointment in nine out of ten cases. The prospects whom you might hit are – current leads, orphan policy, friends, family and clients. Remember the reason the people respond to the letters, ad or any kind of invitation is because they are showing their interest in it. They want to seek information about the products and the services. If you want to set the appointment, you have to give the prospects a good reason to choose your offer. This what the appointment setting services are going to do on your behalf.</p>
<p>Therefore, if as an advisor you buy leads from the call centers and think that the lead themselves can work out, you are wrong in your marketing approach.  For this, you may choose the appointment setting services available at the contact centers to close the leads with ease and comfort. You should also inform the outsourcing company about the objection you face so that they can help you with more easy access of the leads.</p>
