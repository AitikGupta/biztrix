								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We meet different types of client’s everyday during the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/lead-generation.html">lead generation process</a>. We carry on with our transaction, promotion of products, and offer services on behalf of the client companies and in the process we meet up with different intricacies.</p>
<p>How we help our clients? &#8211; We help our clients to nurture leads, generate comparative profits, and keep the sales pipeline growing throughout the campaign.</p>
<p>Lead nurturing is a tough process, and in our previous blogs, we have clearly shown how Fusion deals with the obstructions and dilemmas that come in the path of B2B marketing with three different strategies. However, when we deal with clients, the common question, which we face, is:</p>
<h2><b><i>How Quick and Cheap is the Lead Nurturing at Our Call center?</i></b></h2>
<p>Yes, our clients want a time-saving and cost-affordable lead nurturing. How do we provide them with such facilities? Well, we generally follow 5 basic ideals to meet the cost affordability and time-saving aspects.</p>
<p>Through this blog, we are going to share the prominent strategies that we adopt to help our client get the best potential leads.</p>
<h3>1) Having  the nurturing database</h3>
<p>We include all the people in our database to whom we generally sell the products. These include people whom we might have met at the trade shows, someone who might have spoken with our sales team, or the ones who might have responded through our website.</p>
<h3>2) Reviewing the database</h3>
<p>We check out the database from time to time to see what we know about our customers. In which industries they delve in. What are their designations? Where did we find their names?</p>
<h3>3) To find out what services are the most relevant to customers</h3>
<p>We often sit with our contact center agents and ask them some common question regarding our customers, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What question do the customers ask most often?</li>
<li>What do they care the most?</li>
<li>What issues they generally face?</li>
</ul>
<p>We check the articles, blogs, whitepapers, etc. that addresses different customer issues. We pass on this content by the sales team. We ask the agents, whether the customers value it or not. We can repurpose the content and the Whitepapers can be transformed to articles and finally the articles into blogs.</p>
<h3>4) Email the relevant content to possible prospects, but don’t pitch</h3>
<p>We keep the emails simple as if we are speaking to someone directly. We at Fusion, help our agents and sales team by providing them with email templates, so that they can follow-up easily and engage easily in the new conversations.</p>
<h3>5) Adding the human touch in conversations</h3>
<p>We establish a personal connection with each customer and take them into confidence by adding the human touch to our phone calls. A human voice gains trust of customers easily than the automated machines. We greet them with their names, do ask for feedback at the end of every call just to make the call process a complete one.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we have realized that lead nurturing can be done without the help of expensive automation tools. Our business clients can start-off with simple and cost-effective platforms. Since, our motto is to <b><i>keep everything simple.</i></b></p>
