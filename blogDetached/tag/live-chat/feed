								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Customer experience is the need of the hour. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-quick-tips-can-improve-your-customer-experience-instantly.html">Great customer experience can make your customers happy</a> and happy customers result in more business.  That is why more and more businesses these days are trying to provide their customers with state-of-the-art customer service. </p>



<p>Today when the customers expect nothing but the best
treatment from the company, the standard customer service cannot offer the same
level of satisfaction. For that, you need to shift from reactive to proactive
customer service.&nbsp; </p>



<h2>What is Reactive and Proactive Customer Service?</h2>



<p>Reactive customer service is when a customer has a question
while browsing your website, contacts you via different communication channels
and waits for a response. This is the standard customer service that most companies
provide. </p>



<p>Proactive customer service means anticipating customer
issues and addressing them proactively through a number of communication
channels (including forums, FAQs, knowledge base, and instructional videos).
Reaching out to your customers to inform them about a problem before they have
experienced it is an example of proactive customer service. Proactive customer
service has the power to get your customers live for your brand.</p>



<h2>Why is Proactive Support Important?</h2>



<p>Proactive customer support offers a number of benefits for
your business. These are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increase
customer loyalty</strong> – According to a report by <a href="https://medium.com/@Workato/what-role-will-ai-play-in-the-future-of-customer-service-7332a7e503b7">Enkata</a>
taking initiative in your support can boost customer retention rates by 3-5%.</li><li><strong>Decrease
support calls</strong> – Being proactive can help your business identify issues and
resolve them before they turn into problems, and thus can reduce the number of
tickets you receive.</li><li><strong>Take
charge of communication</strong> – By being proactive you can get involved in what
your customers are saying about your brand in private and on social media.&nbsp; You will also get a chance to engage with
them in a way that puts your business in a favorable light.</li><li><strong>Acquire
new customers</strong> &#8211; By being proactive you will get the opportunities to reach
out to prospective customers, and encourage them to switch to your brand.</li><li><strong>Retain
existing customers</strong> &#8211; When you proactively reach out to your customers, even
when they haven’t mentioned you directly, it deepens the relationship. With
social media customer service on the rage, you will need to go that extra mile
to exceed their expectations of good customer service. </li><li><strong>Create brand
advocates</strong> &#8211; Proactive customer service offers the chance to turn your
customers into brand advocates. &nbsp;Studies
show that a happy customer will tell at least 3 people about their experience.</li><li><strong>Protection
against escalation</strong> &#8211; You can avoid a social crisis by early identification
negativity surrounding your brand. </li></ul>



<p>This shows that proactive is the way to go for customer service.  While reactive customer service will cover your base, proactive customer service will take customer satisfaction and loyalty to a whole new level. According to a study by inContact, consumers were generally positive with proactive service. In fact, 87% of adults surveyed are happy to be contacted proactively by different companies regarding customer service issues. </p>



<h2>So How to Introduce Proactive Customer Service in Your Business? </h2>



<p>Here are a few easy tips:</p>



<h4>1. Ask for Feedback</h4>



<p>Customer service is about giving customers what they want. So, the first thing you have to do is to find out what they want. And the best way to do so is by asking them. If you check on your customers regularly, you may identify your weakness and correct them before your customers start to resent it. </p>



<h4>2. Announce Your Mistakes Before Customers Find Out</h4>



<p>Have you identified a problem in your product, service or
operations? It is better than your customers hear about it directly from you
instead of finding out themselves. Admitting your mistake, apologizing, fixing
the issue quickly, and/or offering a discount to compensate for their
inconvenience can help you earn your customer’s trust, avoid bad PR, and ensure
that the customers do not go anywhere.&nbsp; </p>



<h4>3. Reward Customer Loyalty </h4>



<p>Offering rewards for regular business is a good
loyalty-building tool. Loyalty programs demonstrate your company’s desire to
reward a customer as a token of thanks. You can proactively reach out to
customers with offers in between purchases. This can be a chance for positive
interaction with customers that strengthens their relationship with your
company. For example – you can send a discount voucher to your customers a
month before their subscription with you ends, compelling them to renew the
subscription. </p>



<h4>3. Pay Attention to What Your Customers Are Saying Online</h4>



<p>Pay close attention to what your customers are saying about
your brand online. If you reach out to customers who mentioned your brand in
their post, whether in a good context or bad, you will be able to address their
needs preemptively and increase their customer satisfaction.</p>



<h4>4. Create A Knowledge Base for Common Questions</h4>



<p>If you look carefully, you will find a set of common
questions that your customers frequently ask your customer support team or
search online. If you create a knowledge base where the answers to these
questions are provided, it will help your customers easily get their answers
without calling your customer service department. It will save time and bring
down the number of support calls. </p>



<h4>5. Introduce Live Chat</h4>



<p>Having a <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/live-chat-support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="live chat (opens in a new tab)">live chat</a> on your website helps your customers resolve their queries while browsing your site. According to some, the ability to get answers from a live chat representative during an online purchase is among the most important features a business can offer. Proactively asking your customers if they need help through live chat can result in more business.</p>



<p>These are a few tips that can help your business adopt proactive customer service practices.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this busy world more and more people are turning to texting as well as instant messaging as their primary route of communication. In such a situation, <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/telephone-answering-service-vs-live-chat-service.html">live chat has become growing channel</a> for customer support.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/3159017/best-practices-making-live-chat">Gartner report</a> that its presence as a customer engagement channel will increase from 2% to 10% of all interactions by 2018, with over 80% of companies making it available for their customers.</p>
<p>As understanding customer behavior is vital to delivering outstanding customer service, it is important to reflect on the customer journey. Thanks to the uninterrupted Internet connection, customers these days can look for answers to their questions at any point of time via search engines, FAQs, blogs, forum posts and even social media.</p>
<p>However, it is often seen that they often turn to live chat as it allows them to multitask more efficiently and at the same time, get real-time answers.</p>
<p>To top it off, they can easily bypass the issues they face while using other channels, such as waiting on hold in case of calls and selecting options in case of IVR.</p>
<p>Live chat is one of the first interactions of a customer with a company. Therefore, while using live chat a customer is at an early stage of the customer journey. A company can, therefore, use live chat as an opportunity to delight their customers, reduce channel switching and build customer loyalty.</p>
<p>There are numerous benefits of <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/3-aspects-of-customer-management-strategize-for-live-chat-channels.html">live chat as a customer support channel</a> both for the companies and their customers. However, to reap those benefits, one has to use this channel correctly. Here is a checklist of live chat best practices that can be of help.</p>
<h2>Live Chat Best Practices for a Better Customer Experience</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Ask Questions</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You must be wondering- how clichéd is answering a question with a question? Well, often it is a necessary route to take. This way, you can bypass making assumptions about customer problems and avoid further miscommunication and frustrated channel-switching.</p>
<p>Let your customers know that you are focused on finding a resolution but that you will need more information (as well as confirmation) from them to do so.</p>
<p>This is particularly true in case your prospects use live chat to get an idea of pricing or specific features. But to answer these questions, you almost always need more information.</p>
<p>There will be times when you cannot resolve an issue no matter how many questions you ask. The resolution will take further research. In that case, it is important to let the customer know that. They are looking for fast resolution. If you cannot provide that, you should take measures to reduce their frustration.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Be Concise</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Avoid industry jargons while talking about your product or service. Remember, your customers are not very familiar with technical lingo.  Apart from that, try not to get wordy in your responses, over-explaining or repeating yourself.</p>
<p>Customers using live chat are looking for quick answers. Sometimes they are in a rush, and sometimes they are simply too intimidated to call.  The best way to serve them with a delightful experience is to be concise in your answers and use familiar language.</p>
<p>However, live chat agents should make every effort to avoid typos; it is a one-way road to tarnishing your brand image.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>Be Personable</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Using canned script to answer live chat is a very common practice. But is should be avoided at all cost. It sounds very robotic and lacks the personal touch of a one to one interaction.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to align your live chat strategy with your customer experience strategy. You can empower your agents to empathize with customers to understand their needs and help them reach solutions.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, customers want to feel heard and understood by live humans who will give special importance to their concerns. Modifying the templated answer to support individual customers is the key to a differentiated customer experience.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Build a Knowledgebase</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Building a knowledgebase to answer commonly asked questions is a valuable way to deliver consistency and efficiency in any customer support channel. And live chat support is no exception.</p>
<p>It is a good practice to have quick access to blog posts, how-to articles, troubleshooting manuals, or video tutorials that cover all the typical questions with clarity.</p>
<p>Live chat agents can refer to this knowledgebase while answering customers and direct customers to specific articles for in-depth information. This way, they can provide personable service and consistent responses. Agents too can save time while competently tackling simultaneous chats.</p>
<p>Live chat a customer support channel bound to make a significant impact on the future of the contact center for engaging with your customers and delivering a distinguished customer experience. But it takes careful strategy and meticulous best practices to succeed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often marketers browses various Whitepapers, attends different webinars to know which trends or approaches can let them bring changes in their annual scorecard/bottom-line.</p>
<p>Exchanging notes with the industry experts and the leading entrepreneurs, marketers have started to share their non-core tasks to offshore partners.</p>
<p>As opting for contact centers is a dubious and strategic move, many leaders used to stay away from offshoring due to conventional fears.</p>
<p>In present day, however, many have given up their fears and have started to use outsourcing as a tactic to make reliable profits. In a previous blog, we have shown how Asset Managers of today <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/resolving-assetwealth-management-conundrums-with-next-generation-outsourcing.html" target="_blank">overcame their limitations</a> and chose outsourcing as a strategic tool to cut down on cost and bring change in the service levels.</p>
<p>Now the question is &#8211; How an outsourcing partner can help business to make profitable shifts in their bottom-line. What futuristic approaches are making contact center help business to expand their customer base?</p>
<p>Fusion is going to share three big contact center futuristic trends that will help B2B and B2C clients irrespective of their business size to produce a strong chain of customer and grow a rock-solid scorecard.</p>
<h3>Customer Expectation Going to Rise and That’s a Positive Trait</h3>
<p>In a business, we need to grow our foresight and speculate what might happen next. With excellent customer service from notable vendors, consumer now wants to receive similar treatment from every business or services in nooks and corners of the world. It does not matter whether you are a utility service or a technical support.</p>
<p>When a customer knocks your business, he or she comes predetermined about receiving a higher-level service. With the in-house agents, you cannot accomplish this service goal as they miss the desired skills to provide top-notch customer support.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a contact center can offer your customers a supreme level of customer service.</p>
<p>Some latest features such as customer giving call backs or having Live Video Chat/WebChat with respective agents are simply amazing. It serves your business with real-time benefits. Often, it is hard to equip your in-house agents with state-of-the-art business tools, as they are expensive.</p>
<p>A contact center is always ready to initiate any kind of marketing campaign. So, leveraging your services to contact centers is going to apprehend business goals and will be cost saving.</p>
<p>A good futuristic point that makes a contact center unique from in-house teams is that – <em>contact center people knows what drives a better customer experience.</em></p>
<h3>Communications Using More Than One Channel</h3>
<p>With the use of contact center, a business can eventually increase their customer base just not locally or nationally, but globally. How is it possible? It is simply because call centers offer exposure to your business through a number of channels.</p>
<p>According to the recent study, 77 percent of the customer prefers to use multi-channel in order to seek a service. Hence, the key ingredient is to keep your customer happy and offer them with supports in the real-time.</p>
<p>As said earlier, consumers, today, prefer to use more than one channel. They use a set of new channels such as phone, email, web-based chat, SMS, social media, click to call, screen sharing, etc. This shows that arrays of online digital channels are popular among customers.</p>
<p>It is tricky enough to understand how different types of customer use different channels to seek services. Hence, it is essential for your business to consider <a href="http://bigdoor.com/blog/2013/11/01/a-quick-guide-to-customer-journey-mapping/" target="_blank">customer journey mapping</a>. However, do you have the time to initiate the mapping? If not, contact centers are ready to help you.</p>
<p>How do contact centers help to expand your customer base? How contact centers steer the communication channels to generate positive customer perspective?</p>
<ul>
<li>They move with a definite goal based on you company services and undertakings</li>
<li>Helps your business to decide up on the key points that makes or breaks a relationship with your customer</li>
<li>They involve everyone a prospective customer, or an irate customer, even the one-time or seasonal buyers</li>
</ul>
<h3>Live Agents Offer fresh Lease of Life in Customer Service</h3>
<p>When it comes to customer service, the live conversation via Live Chat or Video Chat has a large role to play. With the rise in self-service options, the quantity of transactions over the live conversation channels is less, but there are instances when the self-services fall short. This make the live agents more focused.</p>
<p>In popular surveys, we find that depending on the nature of the inquiry customer prefers to use the channels. For simple inquiries such as, “<em>What’s My Balance?</em>”, “<em>What’s The Status of My Shipment?</em>” online self-serve help and email are the clear winners.</p>
<p>However, when the inquiry is complex such as a failure in the technical aspects or may be a failure in the order supply, “<em>live agents</em>” are the dominant choice.</p>
<p>Contact centers utilize the Live Chat channels in the most refined manner. They make it viable by –</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilizing the best resources and identifying the key opportunities for chat to analyze website data and customer feedback</li>
<li>Personalizes the interaction that your in-house agents often fail to initiate</li>
<li>They escalate the service to voice when it matter for your business.</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as you leverage the customer support to an outsourcing partner, you will be able to open to viable options of expanding your customer base. Your business will be exposed to a larger demographic, and you will observe a steady escalation in your ROI.</p>
<h3>What Customer’s Feel About Your Business, From the Desk of Fusion –</h3>
<p>At Fusion, we have worked with a number of B2B and B2C companies, who outsource their customer support simply not to expand, but to make their customer “<em>keep coming back</em>.” In these 9 years, we have learned that the customers like someone to take care of them when they need the assistance.</p>
<p>With contact centers such as Fusion, it is possible to attain your customer almost 24/7/6365 days that too in real time with real assistance.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we have realized that positive and happy customers are the keys to unlock reliable profits for companies, irrespective of B2B or B2C.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brand always needs to focus on their best-in store experience via online channels if they want to retain their competitive nature. As the social media buzz is on the rise, Live Chat option is becoming an efficient tool to offer customized and real-time solution to customers.</p>
<p>We know a satisfied customer often entails business growth. Live Chat is one channel that improves customer satisfaction level and helps to see a positive slope in the growth curve.</p>
<p>Yes, the Live Chat is a popular tool deployed by companies to keep customers engaged. It is a potent tool to retain the customer’s fondness for brands. Yet, the key fact is &#8211; it is underutilized.</p>
<p><b>Hello! We are on Chat</b></p>
<p>Many global BPO companies have a strong online strategy, but still they overlook the chat option. The primary reason for companies to stay away from Live Chat option is mainly due to the inability to generate a potential ROI. Often this leads them to the question of aptness of online chat as a customer management channel. In most cases, the failure of Live Chat is due to the flaw in execution strategy.</p>
<p>One of the most critical aspects in business is the management of customer service issues as it comes with multiple trigger points. Online chat is a formal communication mode if compared to email or phone. Formal or informal conversation, customers always expect a quality service, so you need to plan a chat strategy before you implement it.</p>
<p>Fusion BPO has implemented Live Chat and experienced sales boost in their scorecard that made Fusionites fall for this online channel more and more.  How do we deploy a successful chat strategy? What are those triggers that can tune in to the right chat mode?</p>
<p>Well, you need to strategize only three aspects while implementing a Live Chat option, find them below:</p>
<h3>1. Require a Pool of Talent/Skill</h3>
<p>If you want your chat agents to be successful, make sure they focus on the customer effort personalizing every interaction. They must play the role of the facilitator to project a ‘human element’ online.</p>
<p>The most important qualities of a successful chat agent are –</p>
<ul>
<li>He/ She must employ some more time to build rapport and reveal customer needs</li>
<li>Must cross-sell and up-sell with the use of link, video or other sources</li>
<li>Engage with customers in a meaningful conversation</li>
<li>Must complement the self-service mode with right navigation skills</li>
<li>Enable precise response in single chat sessions</li>
<li>Fulfill information security protocols when you take control of the customer’s website</li>
<li>Use text messages to deal with customer complaints</li>
<li>Facilitate effective sales</li>
<li>Represent brand online</li>
<li>Enable seamless appearance</li>
<li>Manage the dead air on chat forums</li>
</ul>
<p>Fusionites working with chat services come jam-packed with these qualities. We frequently train our agents to meet the requisite service level of different clients.</p>
<h3>2. Measure ROI with these Metrics</h3>
<p>Often the state-of-the-art BPOs link up with designing experience and online chat strategies that can work with organizations without a glitch to develop right set of metrics. Talking of chat options, we need to measure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measure the ‘<em>Cost-Per-Contact</em>’ by comparing the cost of service across the channel. The management of multiple chats will help to escalate the agent efficiency compared to phone or email</li>
<li>FCR (<em>First Contact Resolution</em>) to compare the real-time chat value over emails</li>
<li>AOV (<em>Average Order Value</em>) to gauge the talent of agents in up-sell and cross-sell</li>
<li>Measure ‘Sales Conversion Rate’</li>
<li>Have to measure the ‘<em>Deflection Rate</em>’ for the query typed in the expensive channels, this will optimize the resources across channels and calculate the fall in the cost of ownership</li>
<li>This also needs to measure the ‘<em>Escalation Rate</em>’ to build a strong knowledge base and robust training module</li>
<li>Measure the ‘<em>Customer Satisfaction Rate</em>’ to know the success of the chat session</li>
<li>In order to measure compliance of processes internally get to know the ‘<em>Internal Quality Assurance Score</em>’</li>
</ul>
<p>Fusion prefers to stick to these kinds of measurements to keep the gradient positive n customer satisfaction graph.</p>
<h3>3. Seamless Service through Work Force Management (WFM)</h3>
<p>Forecasting and scheduling of resources, two tough situations that we have to face after deploying the online chat channel. For the proper supervision of this issue, an algorithm must run, based on the business norms and probability of offering chat based on the number of visitors daily or during peak hours. Thus, service providers need to employ top-notch WFM practices to optimize resources across the chat platforms.</p>
<p>Fusion also instills best-in-class WFM trends and follows a steady approach to build the chat teams. We employ smart chat platforms that proactively push the chat only if the agent is available, thus helping us to balance the ‘Customer-to-Agent’ ratio.</p>
<p><b>Find Us Online…Anytime</b></p>
<p>Live Chat strategies helps business to experience maximized goals. However, to use the channel effectively Fusion arms chat service with careful planning and execution. A partner like Fusion with proficiency in customer service care can help clients build and deploy effective Live Chat strategy.</p>
