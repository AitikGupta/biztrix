								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the age of the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/how-to-direct-customers-to-the-right-service-channel.html" target="_blank">multi-channel customer service</a>, customers are spoilt with alternative choices of communication channels. With so many channel options in hand, it seems that the customers no longer feel the need to pick up their phones to contact a business.</p>
<p>But contrary to the popular belief, telephone customer care still seems to be one of the most popular and convenient customer service options till date. What can we say? Most people just do not feel comfortable talking to a robotic voice.</p>
<p>People buy from people, and when things go awry, they want to seek assistance from real people. It’s the basic psychology. It is the reason most customers still prefer getting solutions for their problems from live agents who can offer them a comprehensive solution to any complex problems.</p>
<p>They’re also less likely to get angry with a qualified support agent when compared to automated systems and online support channels. As a matter of fact, there are studies that show that a business can generate more revenue from increased customer retention when they opt for a <strong>superior telephone customer support service</strong> from a reputed provider.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at the findings of some such studies.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/diane_clarkson/10-04-06-do_your_customers_want_telephone_you_service" target="_blank">Forrester</a>’s North American Technographics Customer Experience Online Survey, Q4 2009, 69% of consumers prefer talking to a live customer service agent over the telephone. Only 31% have other preferences. The same study also reveals that telephone customer service has the highest customer satisfaction level among the customer service channels used today.</li>
<li>According to a <a href="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/109434/file-333361905-pdf/50_customer_service_facts.pdf" target="_blank">Sales Force study</a>, 81% of consumers are more likely to give repeat business to a company after they’ve had good service. And a 5% increase in customer retention or repeat customers may result in a big chunk of revenue. We are talking about a revenue increase in the 45%-90% range since a large section of repeat customers is big spenders.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6212" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/customer_service_facts.png" alt="Customer service facts" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/customer_service_facts.png 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/customer_service_facts-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Therefore, keeping the customer satisfied is the key to building customer loyalty. And so far, telephone customer service still wears the crown of “<em>highest customer satisfaction level achieved</em>.” It is often observed that customers get frustrated with the company if they do not get to talk to a live agent and get stuck in an IVR maze. Now, that’s an expensive mistake on the company’s part.</p>
<p>Do you think a disappointed customer doesn’t matter to your business? Well, think again. One irate customer is bad news for the business that can only be trumped with more than one irate customer.</p>
<ul>
<li>The customer can voice his disappointment to his friends and family and discourage them from choosing the brand.</li>
<li>He can take the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/12-tips-for-enhanced-customer-service-through-social-media.html" target="_blank">social media route</a> to vent his anger and let more people know about his disappointment and the company’s lack of quality customer service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Word of mouth is always considered to be one of the most powerful advertisements. But the same word of mouth can also make a brand known for all the wrong reasons despite their best efforts.</p>
<p>Therefore, hiring a telephone customer service team is one of the best things a business can do to keep their customers happy. But most importantly, a brand should see the telephone customer service team as an investment that will yield great returns via an increased number of repeat customers that will make their revenue grow by leaps and bounds and not as a cost center.</p>
<p>What do you as a customer prefer? Having to speak with a robot or a real person?</p>
<p>Share your thoughts.</p>
