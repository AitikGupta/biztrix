But the recent trend is that of outsourcing. let us have a look at the reasons that makes outsourcing look so alluring.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2663.png" alt="♣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> When the existing staffs of the medical care units fail to fulfill the call handling duties, outsourcing is the only option. The staffs cannot be blamed for such inability. They are already over worked and are too much bind up with other duties that are equally important if not more. Trying to dedicate more amount of time to the call handling services might have a negative impact on the other duties assigned to them. That is the performance of the medical care unit is to suffer anyway.</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2663.png" alt="♣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> When the business does not have the adequate amount of funds at its disposal to give shape to the plans of in-sourcing. The process of in-sourcing is rather expensive and at the same time becomes a crucial concern. It is very obvious that establishing a whole new answering service set up needs a good bit of time as well as money. More than the infrastructure, the recruitment process eats up the maximum time.</p>

At the end of the day the health care units are driven by profit earning motives.</p>

A point to mention here- many call center companies off late have expanded their scope of functions and have specialized in different fields. Medical answering service is one amongst these specializations.</p>
<p>Usually a medical answering service provider is responsible for answering each and every patient call. It has been made mandatory by the US Supreme Court that the people handling the calls are HIPPA and JACHO certified. These certifications ensure that the agents have a fair enough knowledge of the medical terminologies and other essential features of the medical practice.</p>
<p>Besides attending the patient calls, the call center companies are also responsible to collect and maintain relevant patient data. This data procurement and maintenance does have a role in the smooth conduction of the treatment procedure as well as for future references. The doctors or other medical professionals can access these in the future with a mere click on the mouse.</p>
<p>Again these service providers are also responsible for scheduling appointments. These customer care representatives are like personal secretaries to the doctors in this case. They have a detailed chart of the doctor’s schedule and keep a track of his/her whereabouts that is essential for fixing an appointment.</p>
<p>One of the most critical components of the <strong><a title="medical answering services" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/medical-answering-services.html">medical answering service</a></strong> is the handling of the emergency situations. Most service providers offer the provision of a hotline for emergency purpose. Here again it is necessary for the customer call center companies to have a complete schedule of the doctors and other medical personnel along with their contact numbers to get hold of them in times of emergency.</p>
