<p>Gone are the days when voice calls were the only mode of
communication with a company, and customers had to wait a long time to speak to
a customer service agent.&nbsp; Today, we not
only have numerous communication channels but also have the capability to
initiate communications through such a wide variety of channels from a handheld
device – a smartphone, or tablet. </p>



<p>&nbsp;Today <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/shopping-lists-how-mobile-helps-consumers-tick-all-the-boxes.html">87%</a>
of customers actually use mobile devices to make purchases. &nbsp;However, many businesses are yet to join the
mobile customer service bandwagon. That is not only making their customers
suffer but also is killing the business slowly. With most customers moving on
to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, every customer-facing business
should also be there to provide an excellent and easy-to-use mobile customer
experience.</p>



<p>To provide your customers with a great<a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-omnichannel-customer-service-best-practices-to-boost-customer-experience.html"> customer experience through mobile</a>, you need to understand what customers want. The <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/provide-quality-customer-service-to-the-millennials.html">millennials</a>, the segment of customers with the highest purchasing power, value timely service through the channel of their choice. They also prefer self-service over waiting in the call queue. They are a tech-savvy generation who put much emphasis on ease-of-use and seamless experience. </p>



<p>Keeping these in mind, you should make necessary amends to
your customer service strategies so that it can improve the customer experience
for the mobile-savvy customers. Here’s how you can improve your customer
service via mobile:</p>



<h3>1. Offer
Mobile-friendly self-service materials</h3>



<p>Customers today prefer self-service over everything else.
Being tech-savvy, they can easily resolve their issues through self-service. &nbsp;Therefore, a company should offer ample
self-service materials i.e. mobile-friendly FAQs, documentation and
self-support videos to its mobile-savvy clients.</p>



<h3>2. Display your
customer service button prominently </h3>



<p>Your mobile website or app landing page must have a customer
service button in a place where everyone can find it. Having a prominent
customer service button saves your customers from the hazard of searching for
your customer service number through the tiny screen. It also saves your
customers’ time and improves customer experience.</p>



<h3>3. Provide an easy
way to contact customer support from the mobile without leaving the page</h3>



<p>If a customer has a query regarding one of your products while visiting your website or app via mobile, they should not have to leave the page to communicate with customer support. A prominent, but non-intrusive <em>dial-for-support</em> or<em> live-chat-for-support</em> button can be placed on the website or app allowing your customers to communicate with you without leaving the page. This way, they do not need to remember the product number or other details related to their query and can simply convey them to the customer service agent by looking at the screen.</p>



<h3>4. Single-tap
sensitive customer service links </h3>



<p>Whether you have a mobile app or a mobile-friendly website,
you should always prominently feather customer service links on them.&nbsp; And that link should be single tap sensitive
so that your customers can have access to your customer service department at
the single tap of a link. Remember, in the mobile era, convenience and time
matters above all else. Therefore, a single-tap sensitive customer service link
can be an important step towards improving your customer experience. </p>



<h3>5. A real-time
tracking system for mobile-based customer service queries</h3>



<p>Using a real-time tracking system for mobile-based customer
service queries can be a useful tool to improve customer experience through
outstanding customer service.&nbsp; With the
help of this, you can centralize every customer support requests and queries so
that your agents do not have to log into multiple accounts to answer the
questions. It is also possible to prioritize important questions to be answered
first. This way, you can offer your customers great customer service experience
and track agent productivity at one go.</p>



<p>These are some of the easiest ways to improve your customer
service to adapt to the changing habits of your mobile-savvy customer base.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Fusion, we are no longer dubious about the mobile marketing future in reference to direct response marketing. Current data shows that individual usage of mobile is intensifying and their appetite for mobile ads is becoming growing.</p>
<p>According to the study done by <a href="http://www.iab.net/media/file/Mobile_Phone_Shopping_Diaries_FINAL_100512.pdf" target="_blank">Interactive Advertising Bureau</a> shows that 70% of the customers are in favor of receiving mobile ads on their Smartphone, a stunning metric indeed.</p>
<p>The study also shares the insight on mobile internet usage that is going to surpass the desktop web usage by 2014. Reports suggest that, by 2014, a part of mobile web users will stop or rarely use desktop Internet. Further, some added facts show that the mobile marketing budget is going to rise in the upcoming five years.</p>
<p>Mobile engagement is witnessing a steady escalation because it can generate positive ROI. Data piles up clearly stating that mobile marketing is the fastest medium to produce a result compared to other direct response-marketing channels.</p>
<p>At Fusion BPO Services, we provide effective direct response telemarketing services via <a href="http://www.ocurrance.com/direct-response-telesales.html" target="_blank">O’Currance</a> (a Fusion BPO Group of company).</p>
<p>O’Currance has integrated mobile marketing as the most effective direct response tool in order to drive optimistic results. We are driving growth for our client business positively since the integration. Why did we choose mobile?</p>
<p>Let this blog piece disclose the five good reasons, which influenced O’Currance to integrate mobile strategy in their direct response marketing tactics:</p>
<h3>1. Conversions Generated At a Faster Rate</h3>
<p>Mobile marketing can truncate lead-to-sale&#8217;s pipeline dramatically. Around 70% of the online searches as we stated above generate result in a single month. We must think of the implications going to inherent.</p>
<p>With the use of mobile, we can keep feeding our sales pipeline day in and day out.</p>
<p><a href="http://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/final_global_smartphone_user_study_2012.pdf" target="_blank">Research from the Google</a> shows mobile users are always ready to buy. They are not making searches or simply clicking an ad rather they are the real buyers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5954" alt="Smartphone Users Notice Mobile Ads" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/notice-mobile-ads.jpg" width="600" height="380" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/notice-mobile-ads.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/notice-mobile-ads-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3>2. Customer Engagement takes a Leap</h3>
<p>Google predicts that phrases such as “Call us now” or “Call now” have 8% higher conversion rates than standard mobile ads.</p>
<p>Research also shows that phones conversion rate is 10 to 15 times higher, compared to landing pages. <a href="http://www.biakelsey.com/" target="_blank">BIA Kelsey</a> confirms in their research that 64% of companies say phone calls brings on profitable leads.</p>
<p>How mobile marketing relates to it? Well, mobile generates those phone calls as 52 percent of the mobile ads transforms into phone calls.</p>
<h3>3. Targeting Local Customers</h3>
<p>For direct marketers, targeted advertising is the cherry on the cake. Mobile is one of the best medium for hyper-local targeting. Google let us know where the mobile searchers are in real time, not their apparent location rather their exact location.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-local-now-40-percent-of-mobile-proximity-becomes-a-ranking-variable-97654" target="_blank">Reports</a> suggest that 40% of mobile searches have a local target. Prospects are after immediate solution. Hence, they focus on the local services.</p>
<p>Google further adds saying that 95% of Smartphone users look up for local information regularly and 88% of the users likes to take action within a day.</p>
<p>Local companies must take this advantage immediately. If a business is unable to appear on the mobile search, it will miss profitable leads in 2014.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5953" alt="Smartphone users look up for local information" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/smartphone-local-info.jpg" width="600" height="368" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/smartphone-local-info.jpg 600w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/smartphone-local-info-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3>4. Audience Falls Addicted</h3>
<p>Smartphone are the greatest addiction, we know how it sticks to people through their meals, movie, or even a trip to the restroom.</p>
<p>We the direct marketers are in search of a channel to get our messages in front of the potential customers that will give customers no choice but to look.</p>
<p>We need an easy access to make our message reach out to a wider market. With mobile marketing, Fusion is getting constant access to customers.</p>
<h3>5. Easy Measuring Metrics</h3>
<p>We have realized that performance analytics is a key to gauge our success rate. Marketing cannot rely on branding alone rather they need measurable results.</p>
<p>With Google Analytics, trending mobile industry it has become easy for the direct marketers to <a href="https://www.distilled.net/blog/mobile/tracking-mobile-visitors-in-google-analytics-a-checklist-guide-for-mobile-insights/" target="_blank">track a Smartphone user’s location</a>, how frequently they visit the website and the device they use to search.</p>
<p>Fusionites further integrate Google Analytics Multi-Channel Conversion Path with a call-tracking tool to track every engagement of the customer.</p>
<p><b>Why Fusion Suggests Mobile As The Best Direct Response Marketing Tool?</b></p>
<p>At Fusion, we do not agree with arguments that mobile too young to be crowned as the best direct response tool. We feel mobile marketing as a unique method that shoots up the response rates and success rates.</p>
<p>This opportunity can boost customer engagement, conversion rates and in the long run can generate a profitable ROI.</p>
