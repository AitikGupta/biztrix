								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Customers have always been the king but being a customer in the present era has its own benefits. Sure, one can argue that since the beginning of business, customers were given much importance and as a result, customer service was always an important aspect of business.</p>
<p>But if you look closely, you will realize that the percentage of business owners taking interest in providing their customers with quality customer service is far greater than it previously was. in fact, during the last decade,  the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/customer-service.html" target="_blank">importance of customer service  has increased</a> exponentially.  Which makes us wonder, what can we expect Customer Service to become in the coming decade?</p>
<p>To find out, let’s take a quick look at the changes in the awareness level, both among the customers and the business owners alike.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to Accenture global customer satisfaction report 2008, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130604134550-284615-15-statistics-that-should-change-the-business-world-but-haven-t" target="_blank">price is not the main reason for customer churn</a>; it is actually due to the overall poor quality of customer service.</li>
<li>According to the White House Office of Consumer Affairs as reported by <a href="http://returnonbehavior.com/2010/10/50-facts-about-customer-experience-for-2011/" target="_blank">Return on Behavior</a> magazine Loyal customers are worth up to ten times as much as their first purchase.</li>
<li>70% of buying experiences are based on how the customer feels they are being treated – <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/the_moment_of_truth_in_customer_service" target="_blank">McKinsey</a>.</li>
<li>55% of customers would <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/10/customer-service-stats-55-of-consumers-would-pay-more-for-a-better-service-experience.html" target="_blank">pay extra to guarantee a better service</a> – Defaqto research.</li>
</ul>
<p>if you combine just these four stats together, you  will have no doubt that customer loyalty has  become one of the most sought after realities, to business owners, and, Customer Service is the only thing that can transform a onetime customer into a loyal one.</p>
<p>As customers are becoming more aware of their importance, more and more businesses are coming onboard giving customer service a shout out.</p>
<p>In our industry, some of the most recognizable customer service trends of the present decade include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-channel customer Service</li>
<li>Omni-channel customer service</li>
<li>IVR-Supported customer service</li>
<li>Social customer service</li>
<li>Reduction of wait time and inclusion of call back request</li>
<li>Video call customer support</li>
<li>One tap customer support</li>
</ul>
<p>With more and more businesses nodding in favor of better and more innovative customer support, we can all expect the customer service scene to change even more in the next decade.  So, let’s take a quick look at the possible trends that will still be there in the next decade:</p>
<h2><strong>Multi-Channel Customer Service will be a norm</strong></h2>
<p>With more and more businesses providing multi-channel customer service, it will cease to be deemed as a perk. By the year 2020, the multichannel customer service will become the new norm.</p>
<p><strong>The magnitude of multi-channel will also increase</strong></p>
<p>By 2020, a variety of new social media communication channels will also be included in the bevy of customer service channels. And businesses will surely connect with their customers using the most popular of these channels.</p>
<p><strong>Integration of customer data for all channels will be a reality</strong></p>
<p>In  the near  future,  we will be able to see a complete  integration  of customer data to ensure  that a customer  does not  have to repeat themselves in case they contact a business  more than once, using  different  channels.  If the customer data is stored systematically, an agent can easily take a quick look at it and understand the problem customer is facing, he or she can also suggest the customer some product, based on the purchasing preference data and thus earn a business some additional revenue. The integrated customer data will also help businesses provide a personalized customer service.</p>
<p><strong>More businesses will opt for Customer Service outsourcing</strong></p>
<p>According to a new report from the Economist Intelligence Unit titled <a href="http://www.economistinsights.com/search/node/service%202020" target="_blank">Services 2020: Megatrends</a>, 87% of participants take care of their service offering in-house.  However, in the coming decade, the demand for service provider specialists is likely to increase.</p>
<p>These are some of the  customer service  trends that will be still remain relevant in the year 2020 and  beyond.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If look up “<em>Call center best practices</em>” on the web, you will come across thousands of article telling you exactly the same things – determining goals, hiring the right people, training and  motivating them, understanding the metrics and  so on and  so forth.  All these are very important. But there is also another perspective of determining best practices.</p>
<p>Let us put it this way, all we do in a call center is to interact with our client’s customers and potential customers.  So, shouldn’t their perspective be taken into consideration?  Do contact center managers listen to the customers’ needs, wants and thoughts?</p>
<p>Marketing guru <a href="http://www.1to1media.com/speaking/view.aspx?itemid=33603" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Martha Rogers</a> have summed up customer expectation beautifully in one line-</p>
<p>“<em>People want what they want when they want it</em>.”</p>
<p>Being the lifeline of a business, your customers, should be the first one you should think of when considering best practices. As per a benchmark research report by <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/consumers-lovehate-relationship-with-contact-centers-144866375.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ForeSee</a>, that states the impact customer satisfaction has on success of a call center</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly satisfied consumers are 174% more likely to make contact again than less satisfied customers</li>
<li>They are 154% more likely to purchase next time</li>
<li>238% more likely to recommend the company to friends and family members</li>
</ul>
<p>So, it means that a call center is more likely to succeed if they exceed customer expectations.  And how exactly can they do it? Let’s find out:</p>
<h2>Top 3 Customer Inspired Best Practices for the Contact Center</h2>
<h3><strong>1. Share Information:</strong></h3>
<p>Customers get irritated when information given to the IVR (such as -account number, name, etc.) is lost once their call is transferred to an agent. And they have to repeat the information.  This issue also takes place in case of a multichannel call center.</p>
<p>When a customer switches communication channels, their information provided to the previous channel do not get carried away to the new channel, and they have to provide the information once again.  Now that is surely frustrating.</p>
<p>Thankfully, with more and more call center turning Omni-channel, this problem will soon be a thing of past. In case of <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/deliver-optimum-customer-experience-within-an-omni-channel-strategy.html">Omni-channel</a> call center, the information provided to a channel will seamlessly transfer to another channel along with other related data to another channel when a customer switches the channel.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Better IVR Experience:</strong></h3>
<p>Is your IVR system so complicated that the customers have to shoot arrows in the dark to reach a live agent? If yes, then you are doing it wrong. A complicated IVR is not the right way to treat your customers.  It makes the callers feel frustrated and minimizes the customers chance to get a quick solution to their problems.</p>
<p>In case the customer is calling using a smartphone app or web widget, a business can always give them the opportunity of visual IVR.  This will allow the customers to navigate at their own pace and find out what they want and then contact the concerned department.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Eliminate Hold Time:</strong></h3>
<p>Long hold time is often detrimental to customer satisfaction. It makes the customer feel that their time is not respected. This upsets them.  And when they reach an agent, they are already cranky and irritable.  So, even a minor issue can trigger an outburst at that time.</p>
<p>Giving the customers an option to get a call-back can be a possible solution to the problem. <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/5-ways-a-call-center-can-benefit-using-virtual-queuing.html">Virtual queuing</a> them the option of a scheduled call-back and allow callers select a time that works best for them.  This way, you can eliminate hold time and make customers happy.</p>
<p>These are some possible solutions to some of the most crucial call center issues from the perspective of the customers. Thankfully, these issues can be avoided with a little change in the way call centers deal with each customer.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Omni-channel has become the recent buzzword in customer service. In order to treat the demanding clientele in this highly competitive market, almost all <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/retail-services-call-centers-add-more-customers-to-your-shopping-cart.html">retail businesses are opting for Omni-channel customer experience</a>.</p>
<p>Today’s tech-savvy customers have a penchant for online shopping.  From their online shopping habits, retail can know a lot about their choices.  In an Omni-channel environment where the data integration is seamless, one in-store assistant should be able to utilize the data to help those clients pick their products.</p>
<p>The same thing applies when a customer communicated with a brand. If the customer wishes to change their communication channel and move on to chat from email, a customer service representative should be able to follow the communication across different platforms so that the customer does not have to repeat themselves.</p>
<p>And that is where contact centers come into the picture. When investing in new channels for customer service, every company should ensure that their contact centers are on the same page with its other channels and service offering.</p>
<p>According to Aberdeen research, a company can enjoy major business benefits by integrating their contact centers within their Omni-channel strategy.  At a recent CRMXchange <a href="http://www.crmxchange.com/webcast/omnichannel/sapoct2014.asp" target="_blank">webinar</a>, Omer Minkara of Aberdeen Group presented research findings on the topic. Moving from multichannel to an Omni-channel experience is a very relevant topic today.</p>
<p>As a major part of the customer communication takes place through contact centers these days, it is time to think how an Omni-channel environment can benefit customer service in contact centers. Let us take a look at how the Omni-channel approach can enhance contact center performance:</p>
<h2>Customer Satisfaction</h2>
<p>According to Aberdeen, companies that integrate their contact centers within their Omni-channel strategy often experience an increased level of customer satisfaction which can be noted by a higher customer retention rate and a higher customer lifetime value.</p>
<p>Integrating the contact center within the Omni-channel strategy allows them to provide a consistent all-encompassing state-of-the-art customer service, and that is one major reason for the increased customer satisfaction.</p>
<h2>First Contact Resolution Rate and Average Handling Time</h2>
<p>Other major benefits include improved first contact resolution and shorter waiting time – two of the most essential aspects of customer satisfaction. Customers today frequently use mobile apps and visit web stores. They do not have the patience to wait in a queue. For this reason, an Omni-channel contact center suits them the best.</p>
<p>As a result of seamless data integration of Omni-channel strategy, quick resolution of customer’s problem has also become a possibility.  Equipped with the data from past customer interaction and their purchasing history, a contact center agent is better suited to help the customers. It also allows them to resolve customers’ queries faster.</p>
<p>As per Aberdeen research, <a href="http://www.sap.com/bin/sapcom/en_us/downloadasset.2014-06-jun-06-15.the-business-value-of-integrating-the-contact-center-within-your-omni-channel-strategy-pdf.bypassReg.html" target="_blank">contact center agents spend 14% of their time searching for data</a> from different systems. Unifying the relevant data on a single screen improves both first call resolution rates and average handling time.</p>
<h2>Average Waiting Time</h2>
<p>The first contact resolution rate can be increased by equipping the contact center agents with access to relevant customer data. It frees the agent’s time that they can then invest in offering quality service to the customers. Not having to look for data also allows them to handle more calls, which leads to shorter wait times for customers.</p>
<p>Apart from that, by integrating all communication channels in the same solution, the companies can be able to deliver a consistent, speedy customer service through all those channels. With access to adequate consumer data, it can also be possible to route the contacts to the right agent in no time.</p>
<p>To sum it all, integrating your contact center within an Omni- channel strategy makes the contact center operations easier and helps agents meet the customer expectations by offering quick and high-quality customer service.</p>
