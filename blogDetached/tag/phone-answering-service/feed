								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Interactive-Voice-Response.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4494" title="Interactive-Voice-Response" src="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Interactive-Voice-Response-300x210.gif" alt="" width="300" height="210" srcset="https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Interactive-Voice-Response-300x210.gif 300w, https://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Interactive-Voice-Response.gif 428w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Many phone answering service call centers prefer to have speech/voice enabled menus in Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems and there are others who prefer to have Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) based menu systems. There are pros and cons associated with both systems in the <strong><a title="phone answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">phone answering service</a></strong> call centers; the businesses must make a suitable choice depending on their clients’ and customers’ needs.</p>
<p><strong>Voice enabled IVR</strong></p>
<p>The advantages are that it is much easier for the customers to say the answer or utter an option to the question asked by the call answering service, rather than typing the option on the keypad. For mobile users, this option is perfect. The menu options can be unlimited in this case, and the customers can also jump from option to option quite easily by just uttering words.</p>
<p>However, the customers must be sure not to speak in noisy conditions and when the network signals are low. If there are disturbances on lines, the call answering service will not be able to record and register what the customers are saying and hence the system too will not be able to act upon it.</p>
<p><strong>DTMF based IVR</strong></p>
<p>This option is perfect for the landline users and for people who use hands-free for mobile. Today, a lot of people are aware about tone dialing and know the usage of IVR through pressing the right keys. DTMF signals do not get distorted and the response is also made faster.</p>
<p>Howvere, this option may not be appropriate for the old people who have shaking and trembling fingers, as they might not be able to type the right keys in time.</p>

This is an undoubtedly lucrative business. If you are thinking about starting such a business, I will surely encourage you. Because of this business provides better return against your investments. However, the income from such a business actually depends on the number of clients you have in your clientele. The more clients you have the more revenue you can generate. This is as simple as that. Besides it also depends on how many hours a day you will work. The more hours you will work the more you can earn. If you run a <strong><a title="24 hour answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/ ">24 hour answering service</a></strong>, you will surely earn more. Usually the clients pay set amount of money every month for specific number of calls. If there are additional calls, they will pay at a pre-decided rate for the extra calls.</p>

<p><strong>Economic service</strong>: By now it is an established fact that call center outsourcing is an economic arrangement than the option of in-sourcing. The business enterprise can save quite a significant amount of business operational funds when a competent customer call center company is appointed.</p>
<p>Not only economic, this option is easy and convenient too. It saves the business houses from the hassles to establishing a whole new customer care department. There are the hassles of arranging extra space, hassles of hiring fresh faces, hassles of training these new recruits and a lot more.</p>
<p>More than anything else in-sourcing is expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Constant service</strong>: Another incentive for appointing a specialized <strong><a title="phone answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">phone answering service</a></strong> provider is to benefit from an all round the clock customer care service. The call center companies have adequate staff so as to provide support services to the customers throughout the day as well as night.</p>
<p><strong>Impeccable service</strong>: Flawless service, this matters a lot. With an able call center company by the side you can be assured that not a single customer call will go unanswered. And this has a role to play in portraying a positive image of your business.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient service</strong>: The call center agents do not only receive every single call, but they receive it within the first three rings. Such an effort does away with one of the major customer complaints that they are put on hold for log times. And as far as putting on hold in between the calls is concerned, one of the key efficiency check parameters of call center employees is average call handling time. To provetheir efficiency the agents sort out every issue as fast as possible.</p>

Actually it is the option of outsourcing answering service in US that has appealed more to the US based businesses. Although initially the practice of business process outsourcing was limited to the geographical boundaries of the country, things have changed off late.</p>
<p>Now, it is an offshore customer call center that is preferred over the US call center companies. Why such sudden change in the preferences. It definitely has valid reasons behind it. Let’s figure out the reasons. If the offshore outsourcing destinations are taken into consideration one major trend can be noticed. The most preferred outsourcing destinations are the third world developing nations. And yes such preference like any other business move is guided by profit motives. Wondering what can be the motive in this case. It is very simple. To get quality service from the cheap labor force is the idea. The low expenses on labor bring down the overall expenses substantially.</p>
<p>If the monetary advantages are to be considered then there are more, the governments of these host countries offers fiscal as well as non fiscal incentive to the foreign investors. Such action of the government is guided by the motives of economic growth and development of these third world nations. And in this struggle of economic resurgence the call center industry can play a crucial part.</p>
<p>Besides the cost factor there are other advantages like that makes offshore outsourcing a possibility infact a rewarding deal.</p>

The callers may contact an answering service call center with a general query on a product or service or an issue about a product/service; before a phone answering service agent advances to offer solutions, they must ask certain questions that enable them to help customers better and in a more effective manner. This may often end up in saving a lot of time for both the answering services and the callers.</p>
<p>For instance, if the caller has called to ask the agent how they can pay for ordering a product or service, the agents at the <strong><a title="live answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">live answering service</a></strong> call center must ask what mode of payment is convenient for the customers. This will help the conversation to be channelized; this implies that the caller will give a reply and the solution by the agents will be offered depending on this answer rather than saying about all the payment options and then having to repeat the solution after the caller tells of his/her choice of payment.</p>
<p>If agents are trained well to ask effective questions to the callers, the course of the conversation can also be directed towards convincing the callers in making purchases. The expertise of the agents lies in how well they are capable of asking the right questions on the spot and getting the customers to make purchases, repeat purchases or instill in their minds an interest on the clients’ products/services.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All Philippines call centers make special efforts at designing training programs so that the agents know what they are supposed to do and how they are expected to do so. The training sessions can be effective or they might not be effective; it is up to the Philippines call centers to find out if the venture has been successful. All agents are not trained well using the same equipments and mechanisms; there are some phone answering service agents who are trained better through pictorial descriptions and flow charts, whereas others might learn better when provided lectures or theoretical classes.</p>
<p>However, no amount of training will tell that it is successful until the agents are tested on what they have been coached. The <strong><a title="phone answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">phone answering service</a></strong> managers must create opportunities that make agents deal with crisis situations that they have to face for real on the job. Half of the agents are made to play the role of difficult and upset customers, and the rest of the agents play the role of agents trying to calm down and offer solutions to those customers. The role is reversed for every agent, so that everyone gets a chance to play the role of agents and customers.</p>
<p>The managers and supervisors at Philippines call centers mark the agents on their performance and retrain agents who have not been able to reach the standard expected from them.  Only when the agents are able to offer the kind of service expected of them, can the training session be called successful.</p>

It is to be noted that all IVR systems have three kinds of cost components that must be considered apart from the upgrading costs and the general maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The first IVR cost component that is considered usually by <strong><a title="phone answering service" href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/answering-service.html">phone answering service</a></strong> call centers is the cost of CTI hardware and the computer systems. This is a fixed as well as one-time cost, and the call answering service will not have to invest in it unless certain amount of capacity enhancement is required in future.</p>
<p>The second component is the cost involved in customized voice application. The IVR call flow implementation costs can also include integration with third party applications such as web services and customer relationship management (CRM). The call centers must either invest in in-house qualified man power or can get the voice application tool developed from the IVR software providers.</p>
<p>The third component is the telephone cost; the costs can be charged on per call per minute basis as per the convenience of the businesses and organizations. When human agents interact with the IVR callers in the phone answering service call centers, the call transfer cost gets very high in the long run. This is dependent on the call volume.</p>
<p>After the center decides what they need, on premise IVR system or hosted IVR, they can think about the cost components and deploy the right IVR system for the center.</p>

For making IVR user-friendly, the phone answering service call centers have to focus on scripting menus, categorizing the complex menus into simpler sub-menus, as well as scripting phrases that are used for offering information.</p>
<p>In case of scripting, the menu options must be clearly scripted and accuracy of options is a must. The options must be appropriate so that callers can understand all options clearly. When dividing the complex or large options in IVR systems, live answering service firms either group options or categorizes options in two-level menus instead of having one. This assists the first time callers of businesses in using the IVR system and makes the entire process a smooth affair. This kind of division also makes the process much faster and saves time for the callers.</p>
