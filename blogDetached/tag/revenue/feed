								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to ramp up your sales quotas and drive sales effectiveness, outsourcing your sales job is no doubt the best option you&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>Whether your business pattern is B2B or B2C, you need to &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the perfect balance to traditional and new techniques</li>
<li>Reach your customers in time</li>
<li>Help your company get higher returns on the revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>You sell product and services and for that you have to find out the right platform to serve your customers in a synchronized manner. In that case, a sales call center is the perfect solution for both B2B and B2C companies.</p>
<p>Sales and marketing are the two sides of the same coin. Well, both focuses on the facet of helping people and get rewards in return.  At Fusion, we know how a sales call center can generate quality revenue from the Day One and we incorporate that in every campaign.</p>
<p>Here, Fusion clusters seven basic ways we turn each agent into valuable sales professionals for any business from Day One of the sales campaign:</p>
<h3>Hiring Phone Fighters</h3>
<p>The people whom we hire at our workstation are not afraid to make a high volume of calls. Call savvy agents are the typical demand of any sales campaign. We do not recruit those people who used to make 10 to 20 calls per day, it sounds like hunting elephant.</p>
<p>Moreover, equipping call centers with the younger generation is the best possible option. Those young brains are ready to carry instructions actively and have no bad habits to break.</p>
<h3>Enabling Personalized Selling</h3>
<p>Personalized selling is one of the important aspects, which starts as soon as we start dealing with customers directly. From Day One of the campaigns, Fusionites make themselves stay connected with the customer, to make the sale viable.</p>
<p>We have evaluated that remembering the name of customers, understanding their point of views or feeling for them is a great help in the path of generating revenue. This help to grow customers trust towards the brand we promote, thus making a profitable sale.</p>
<h3>Enabling Incentives</h3>
<p>Incentives are the rewarding element inside a call center. This helps to motivate the sales staff. Therefore, an improved call center will keep the sales incentives in place for their sales teams.</p>
<p>Experts comments that focusing on non-variable compensation with achievement compensation can drive in more sales. Fusion supports the statement and keeps the sales incentive in order to encourage the staffs.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>Training is one of the critical aspects that a call center follows strictly. Training makes sure that agents qualify with certain typical characteristics such as passing the gatekeepers, use of proper communication skills.</p>
<p>Fusion thus instills valuable propositions and competitive information in sales representatives to drive in more revenue.</p>
<p>Fusion trains people effectively to recognize sales opportunity, turn a simple customer interaction to sales interaction and finally making them learn tactics to overcome customer objection.</p>
<h3>Employing Correct Call Center Metrics</h3>
<p>If the call center agents start selling products, it is the duty of the call center owners to instill <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/is-your-contact-center-tracking-the-right-metrics.html">right call center metrics</a> to measure the performance and encourage agents to meet business goals.</p>
<p>In the sales driven call centers, a sales agent has to manage a huge volume of call. In this aspect, Fusion thinks that using performance-based metrics instead of volume based metrics helps to measure success of call center in a better manner.</p>
<h3>Focusing on Goals</h3>
<p>Call centers must set realistic expectations and stay in line with the product and service. This does not only include the revenue, but also calls made per day, conversations, appointments made per week and pipeline. This measurement has helped Fusion to set the goal appropriately.</p>
<h3>Added ROI</h3>
<p>In the telemarketing arena, the primary concern for the call centers is to generate ROI from Day One of the campaigns. The simple call center logic says, “<em>More number of calls equals more conversions, keeps the sales pipeline filled with saleable leads</em>”.</p>
<p>Fusion has incorporated this trait as the team DNA, thus cultivating a successful call center force.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we use these simple tips to make our sales call center agents sustainable from Day One of the campaigns. We employ revenue generating sales force. Properly training those people on the client’s product and services, motivating them, and asking them to stay focused on targets.</p>
