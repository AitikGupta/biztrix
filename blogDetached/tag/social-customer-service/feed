<p>Social customer service is an important tool to build
customer experience, drive loyalty, enhance brand reputation and lower
operational expenses by reducing the volume of customer service calls.&nbsp; However, in order to successfully cater to
your customers through social customer service you need to offer quick response
and resolution. </p>



<p>Exposed to the gold standard of customer service, consumers
today want answers to their queries and resolutions to their issues and they
want it right now. They do not have time to wait for a day to get a response of
an email or to wait in an IVR queue to talk to another human. In such
situations social customer support can come to the company’s rescue.&nbsp; When done rightly the personal, knowledgeable
and helpful nature of social customer service can not only resolve customer
issues pronto but can also drive better customer experience and boost brand
reputation.</p>



<p>But the question is, how can a brand with limited resources,
small teams, and isolated departments (CRM, helpdesk, customer support, and
social) deliver faster and more effective customer care interactions via social
media? Here are a few tips:</p>



<h3>1. Show the human face of your company</h3>



<p>Your customers prefer interacting with other people, not
automated systems. Social customer care agents can quickly connect with
consumers on a personal level by showing empathy for the consumer and their
issues.&nbsp; And thus, they create the opportunity
to diagnose an issue further, leading to quicker resolution. This also improves
your brand perception.</p>



<h3>2. Acknowledge pronto</h3>



<p>It is possible that a social customer care agent may not
have all the answers or that resolving the issue requires the customer to be
redirected to another department or channel (for due to personally identifiable
information requirements or other sensitive information), the agent must let
the customer know that they are on the care and the brand cares for its
customers. Customers today are willing to wait a little if the company
acknowledges their requests or issues. </p>



<p>In case an issue cannot be resolved right away, the agents
should provide the customer with a timeframe and stick to it. A little delay
here and there is okay but do not go a whole day past the deadline to provide a
response.&nbsp; This way your company can lose
their precious goodwill.</p>



<h3>3. Don’t compel customer to change the channel unless absolutely necessary</h3>



<p>Customers today prefer to get a response to their issue in
the same channel through which they interacted with the company regarding the
issue.&nbsp; While there are times when
conversations need to be taken offline, businesses should attempt to respond to
issues publicly through the same channel where the inquiry is made. Pushing your
customers from one channel to another is never a good idea. This leads to
confusion and frustration and increases the resolution time significantly.</p>



<h3>4. Clearly mention operating hours</h3>



<p>If you can’t provide 24-hour social care support, have the information clearly listed across all channels. Better still <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com">hire a BPO for managing your social customer care</a> during the non-operational hours.  If that is not an option for you, make sure to list other communication channels of your brand, as well as links to other useful information, FAQs, easy-fix videos, and much more.</p>



<h3>5. Get the right for the right job</h3>



<p>Your social care team should be armed with the right tools
and training, and tested against any type of scenarios. You can either integrate
social experts into the traditional call center or transition and train members
of the call center for social response. Availing the social customer care
services from a reputed BPO can also be a solution. However, be sure to have a
tight integration between your inhouse customer service team and the outsourced
ones. This will help you identify mass issues quickly by addressing your
customers through proactive posts and messages across all communication
channels. It will also reduce the response time and volume of inquiries through
social and traditional channels. </p>



<h3>6. FAQs and pre-approved information</h3>



<p>If you analyze the queries carefully, you can always find a
list of questions that are repeated time and again across all channels. You can
easily develop a list of these FAQs with their responses, get it approved and
keep it stored in a content library for quick distribution. This will help you
in reducing the social care response time and costs and improve the efficacy of
your social care team.</p>



<h3>7. Know the Customers</h3>



<p>Knowing your customers and understanding their value to your
company can help you prioritize responses and decide the way some individual
cases are handled. A customer with a wide social footprint, or a brand advocate
with deep knowledge about your product should get a priority treatment.&nbsp; Therefore, social care agents must look for
social profile information of a customer before responding. </p>



<p>However, you must also know the time when most of your
customers are active on social media and manage your workforces accordingly to
provide quick and efficient resolutions to all your customers. The response
provided to all customers should be prompts, personalized with thoughtful in
order to increase their satisfaction level.</p>



<h3>8. Get Right Tools</h3>



<p>You need to have the right tools and technology in place for more effective and efficient care. With the use of monitoring, categorization, filtering and automated routing, together with approval workflows and measurement as well as reporting capabilities social care efforts can be speeded up and improved.</p>



<p>Like all customer service channels social customer service too needs to be managed quickly and thoughtfully. If you do not speed up the response times, or leave questions unanswered your customers will feel devalued and frustrated and will vent their annoyance in public. Therefore, bad social customer service is worse than having no social customer service at all. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want to provide effective social customer service, you need to be prompt. However, with a growing number of social platforms as well as customers using social media as a support channel, many businesses are finding it difficult to keep up.</p>
<p>Even businesses with dedicated social customer service teams are looking for ways to efficiently go through all the comments and questions directed at them <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/customers-switch-channels-for-issue-resolution.html">via various social media channels</a>.</p>
<p>As teams try hard to streamline and optimize their processes, choosing the right metrics and tracking them regularly becomes increasingly important.  Here are five key social customer service performance indicators, every business should be tracking daily:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>Social Activity per Hour</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you track social activity broken down by the hour, it will help you better understand your workload. Keeping track of this information on a daily basis will allow you to recognize traffic patterns and prepare for spikes in interactions.</p>
<p>Knowing the social activity per hour also allows a business to staff their team strategically, so that optimum coverage during high traffic, times can be forecasted. There are times when social traffic takes place beyond usual business hours.</p>
<p>Tracking this metric will help businesses prepare for those times, by creating additional shifts or hiring a support team in another time zone.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2>Response Rates</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is beneficial to know how quickly your team is able to respond to customer queries and/or feedback that require a response. It will help you track average response times by the day of the week and time of the day.</p>
<p>This will help you find out if and when the response times are falling short of your goals; if it happens during a particular time of the day, and you need to adjust your staffing levels.</p>
<p>Apart from this, tracking average time to first action will also be beneficial for your business. In cases where customer inquiries are more complicated than others, it is natural for your social customer service team to need more time to respond to certain requests.</p>
<p>However, they should be able to provide an initial response within the expected time frame.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2>Engagement with Unique Users</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want a better understanding of the <a href="http://www.sociableblog.com/">impact of social media</a> and the reach of your brand, you need to track the number of times your company is mentioned each day and break that number down into unique mentions.</p>
<p>Pay more attention to these unique mentions and track the engagement your team has with this particular subset. This highlights the <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/blog/social-customer-services-personalize-customer-support.html">importance of social customer service</a> in maintaining as well as building relationships with your customers.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2>Customer Sentiment</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding customer sentiment should not only be seen as a key performance indicator, it can also provide a business with actionable insight. As you <a href="http://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-business/5-tools-tracking-brand-mentions-youll-actually-want-use">track the brand mentions</a> every single time, you get to measure the sentiment in specific areas that matter to your business.</p>
<p>For example: a hotel should measure sentiments in areas like ease of check-in, booking, food, room amenities etc. At the same time, a manufacturer of consumer packaged goods should measure sentiments for product quality, price, purchase process, availability, and offers.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2>Total Mentions That Require Actions</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A business should track all brand mentions that require actions. Setting up separate feeds populated with customer mentions flagged as requiring a response can make this easier for the team. With a queue of mentions that require action, your team will be able to deliver effective responses without missing a single customer.</p>
<p>As a need connoisseur of social media customer service, you should start by tracking these five key performance indicators and add them to the list of tracked data as per the unique requirements of your business.</p>
<p>Tracking these on a regular basis will equip your social customer service team with the insight and tools they need to provide high-quality customer experience to your customers.</p>
