								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The all new Tesla Energy comes with a majestic plan to power the world without making it more dependent on the grid. Tesla Energy has announced that a ten kilowatt-hour home battery called the <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Powerwall</a> will soon be available.</p>
<p>The big brother of the Powerwall is called the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/30/tesla-powerwall-battery_n_7186534.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Powerpack</a>.  Tesla explains it as an &#8220;infinitely scalable system&#8221; that can work for businesses, industrial applications, and even public utility companies. It comes in 100 kWh battery blocks that can range from 500 kWH up to 10 MWh and above.</p>
<p>And do you know the best part? All the energy is 100% responsibly sourced from a renewable resource – it is nothing but solar energy. There is no need to use exhaustible natural resources like coal and crude oil to generate power.</p>
<p>As a business process outsourcer, Fusion recognizes that the power solution will revolutionize the call center industry with a burst of clean energy.  Here, it shares a comprehensive list of the benefits of a Tesla Powerpack &#8211;</p>
<p><strong>Reduce Cost</strong> &#8211; What happens when a business does not have to depend on the grid during the peak consumption hours? With the Powerpack, any business can use electricity without having to worry about hefty bills. As a result, the cost of operation comes down. It is especially true for a call center that runs 24X7 and is always in need of electricity.</p>
<p><strong>Disaster Management</strong> – The all new power solution from Tesla can also come in handy in case a disaster, natural or manmade, takes place. With help of the Powerpack, a business can stay open even in such a situation. In case of medical institutions, insurance companies, and customer support industry this battery can be indispensable.</p>
<p><strong>Renewable Source</strong> – The all new Powerpack uses the sun as its energy source. Yes, the sun. So they do not have to worry about using up natural resources to generate power. The solar energy is a renewable resource that offers us clean energy every single day. The Powerpack just stores the solar power. It can be used even when the sun is not shining.</p>
<p><strong>Going Green </strong>&#8211; As this new power solution is nothing but a system of solar power storage; it is indeed a green energy solution. The sun is our prime resource of clean energy that is available across the world almost every day. Storing solar energy efficiently to power factories, call centers, data centers and much more can not only bring down the utility bills of a company but also the power will be responsibly sourced. It will help a company minimize their carbon footprints and do something for the environment.</p>
<p><strong>A Good Backup </strong>&#8211; Even if a consumer does not use solar power on a regular basis, the Powerpack, as well as the Powerwall can come in handy for them in case of a prolonged power outage. It is especially beneficial for the call center industry that serves its clients on a 24X7 basis.</p>
