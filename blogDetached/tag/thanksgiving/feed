								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What makes the fourth Saturday of November so special? Is it the opulence of food? Is it the fact that the holidays are coming closer? Or is it the bliss of togetherness and the gratitude for having good company? We think it’s the last one &#8211; after all, the holiday is called thanksgiving.</p>
<p>It’s time to give thanks to every person who made your world a better place with their presence. The same thing applies for businesses as well. They should give thanks to every person who helped the business rise to success i.e. its employees, vendors, investors and most importantly, its customers, without whom, there won’t be a business.</p>
<p>But just merely saying a thank you or sending a thanksgiving themed mail to your customers won’t cut it this Thanksgiving. With the competition getting steeper by the day, it’s time your actions start speaking louder than your words. Make the customers feel special and appreciated, and, thank them earnestly for their continued support. Here are a few tips for practicing what you preach.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Customize your email</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We know it is hard to write personalized emails to each and every one of your customers. But you can at least customize your emails targeting your brand loyalists who have stuck with you for a long period of time. They would love to know once in a while that the brand they love has high esteem for them.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Offer free service</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Track the last purchase of each customer and mail them a promo code for free servicing on the same or offer them a discount on its accessories. It will improve their brand experience and turn them into loyal customers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>Do not make them wait</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We know holidays can be hectic, especially for the customer service department. But when a customer calls your customer service number, he or she is not in the mood for waiting in a long call queue, they can use that time to do something else. Don’t keep them waiting. Hire more customer service agents or seek the help of <strong>a renowned call center </strong>well in advance. Thanksgiving is just the beginning or a long shopping season and you need to be on your toes.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Ask them for feedback</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A busy season is no excuse for delivering poor customer experience. And even if there’s an occasional setback, make sure to amend your ways. Ask the customers what can make your product or service better and thank them for their feedback. Work on Improving things and let them know that you are working on it.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3>Keep your promises</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t just give your customers false hope that things will be better if you can’t make it better. Giving false hope and failing to deliver are a deadly combo and the surest way to your doom.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3>Keep practicing what you preach</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>‘Thank You’ is too important and too powerful a tool to confine to just a single holiday. Keep thanking your customers by making every effort possible to make their experience with you worthwhile. We already know customer experience is one of the most vital factors that can turn a first time customer into a loyal one.</p>
<h3><strong>Happy Thanksgiving from all of us at Fusion.</strong></h3>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every Thanksgiving we reflect and give thanks for many great things in our lives — people, skills, opportunities and the comforts.  However, it is also a good time to give thanks to the customers who have been there for us throughout the year. Long-term customers stay with businesses through thick and thin.</p>
<p>Therefore, they need to be thanks. But that’s not all, thanking customers is also a proven method of customer retention, building relationship and promoting sales in the future.</p>
<p>So, in the spirit of giving thanks, let us discuss some of the best ways of showing appreciation to our loyal customers.</p>
<p>It is an open secret that keeping a customer is easier that finding a new customer and its cheaper too. According to a study by Lee Resource Inc.,  it takes five times more cost  to attract a new customer  than  <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexlawrence/2012/11/01/five-customer-retention-tips-for-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank">to keep an existing  one</a>.  So, one should not have a shadow of doubt in their mind about what a business should be doing. Find out how a little recognition can go a long way and help you keep your loyal customers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong>Value Their Feedback</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No business owner wants to get a negative customer review either on their website or their product page. According to a survey by Dimensional Research, 90% of customers say their buying decisions are influenced by online reviews.</p>
<p>However, if you look at it, addressing negativity and getting to the bottom of it might actually do well to your business. You will get the opportunity to have an insight of what your customers want and will be able to make things right by making the right adjustments.</p>
<p>This negativity can also be used in buyer persona research.</p>
<p>At Fusion we deal with negative comments in a positive way.  We analyze them to find out if there was some fault on our part. If there is, we make prompt effort to make things right and see to it that such things do not occur in the near future. If we did not make any mistakes, we politely would discuss that with our customers and sort out the misunderstanding.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong>Use Your Words to Show Gratitude</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to dealing with customers, there is no substitute of personal contact and interaction.  It helps to reach out at the probable time to just say thank you.   However, if you reach out to them at the unexpected times, it can go a long a way building your relationship stronger. It can also bring you some great feedbacks regarding how you can improve your product or service.</p>
<p>You can reach out to customers via phone, a hand-written note or a personalized email. They all make your customers feel special and taken care of.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we believe in adding a personal touch.  We send personalized emails, reach out to our clients via phone and send gifts and cards to make our relationship stronger.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong>Invest in a CRM System</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A CRM (customer relationship management) system not only helps your internal team through organization and automation tools, but also assists you in delivering better customer experience. It assists you in becoming a patient listener and helps in keeping your customers delighted.  The right CRM allows you to see your customers’ interactions and conversations at a glance. When you know the types of content your customers are viewing on your site, you can meet their needs with ease and in a timely manner.</p>
<p>At Fusion, we use a CRM to serve our customers better.  It helps us find out what each of our customers need, and we ensure that we offer them the best possible solution.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2><strong>Send Business To Your Customers.</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re a B2B company, you often have customers or clients from different industry verticals. So, you may have opportunities to share networking contacts that will mutually benefit you and your clients. Setting up your customers with potential business leads shows them that you value their work, which is a big appreciation for any customer. This kind of behavior is sure to lead to a stronger bond, stronger networking, more business and better revenue.</p>
<p>Being a global business process outsourcing provider, Fusion has a huge network of clients from different verticals. We share a healthy professional relationship with all of them.  We also share networking contacts with them that can land them a new client. It is our way of showing our respect.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2><strong>Support their Charitable Cause.</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Make a donation to a food bank, homeless shelter, or another nonprofit that the customer supports. Giving back to the community that they support is sure to make your customers happy about doing business with you.</p>
<p>For the past three years, Fusion has <a href="http://www.fusionbposervices.com/csr-canada.html" target="_blank">supported</a> St. George Bay Sick Children Foundation in Newfoundland. This foundation has raised more than $320,000 in the past decade and has provided over 150 families with financial aid necessary. Their children have traveled to healthcare facilities in London, Guelph, Toronto, Ottawa, Halifax and St. John&#8217;s. Our staff members from STV Newfoundland operate the phones to accept pledges from around the world. This year we have also donated a small contribution to the foundation. Many of our clients too support this organization.</p>
<p>Saying occasional ‘thank you’ to your customers is not enough.  Your actions should speak louder than your words to make them feel that you really care.</p>
